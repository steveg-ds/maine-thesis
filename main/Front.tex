\begin{abstract}
This thesis explores rural housing insecurity through Swope and Hernandezâ€™s (2019) 4 C's of housing insecurity in rural areas. Little attention has been paid to rural areas in the conversation on housing insecurity and houselessness. To facilitate further discussion on this understudied issue, this exploratory study used unsupervised machine learning to group census tracts into risk levels across 7 axes of data from the American Community Survey. These were based on housing insecurity factors found in the literature. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine variation between U.S. states based on how well state risk levels could be predicted with the national dataset. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation was used to analyze how spatially clustered the risk levels and housing insecurity risk variables.  The results indicate that many rural census tracts have a medium risk of housing insecurity, and the risk levels are hard to predict. The spatial autocorrelation results show that the housing insecurity variables were not as highly spatially clustered as expected.

This thesis delves into the challenges of insecure housing in rural areas, drawing from Swope and Hernandez's comprehensive 4 C's framework outlined in 2019. Remarkably, rural regions have been overlooked in conversations about housing insecurity and homelessness. To shed light on this neglected issue, this investigation utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques. It categorized census tracts into risk levels across seven key data axes sourced from the American Community Survey, focusing on factors commonly associated with housing insecurity as documented in existing literature.

By employing multinomial logistic regression, the study aimed to discern variations among U.S. states, determining how accurately state risk levels aligned with the national dataset. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation analysis was employed to gauge the extent of spatial clustering within the identified risk levels and housing insecurity factors.

The findings uncover that numerous rural census tracts exhibit a moderate risk of housing insecurity, yet predicting these risk levels proves challenging. Intriguingly, the spatial autocorrelation analysis suggests that the housing insecurity variables didn't exhibit the anticipated high levels of spatial clustering.
