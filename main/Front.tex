\begin{abstract}
This paper explores rural housing insecurity through Swope and Hernandez’s (2019) 4 C's of housing insecurity in rural areas. Rural census tracts are defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Urban Code Continuum (RUCA) codes seven through ten to avoid an overly restrictive definition.  Little attention has been paid to rural areas in the conversation on housing, to facilitate further discussion this exploratory study uses unsupervised machine learning to group census tracts into risk levels across 7 sectors of ACS data based on housing insecurity factors found in the literature. Multinomial logistic regression is used to determine variation between states based on how well state risk levels can be predicted with the national dataset. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation is used to analyze how spatially clustered the risk levels and housing insecurity risk variables.  The results indicate that many rural census tracts have a medium risk of housing insecurity, and the risk levels are hard to predict. The spatial autocorrelation results show that the housing insecurity variables are not as highly spatially clustered as expected.
