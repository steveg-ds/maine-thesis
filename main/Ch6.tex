Housing insecurity is difficult in several different ways. First, it is difficult to define. Until there is a full understanding of housing insecurity, which includes amending the gap between urban and rural housing insecurity research, we are limited in our ability to properly operationalize the meaning of the phrase. Second, it is difficult to study. As a concept that spans such a wide range of individual, social, and political factors is inherently difficult to study. Third, and most importantly, housing insecurity is difficult for those who experience it. In rural areas, these difficulties are compounded due to the urban-centric lens of housing insecurity that has developed over decades of primarily urban-oriented research. This initial exploration hopes to serve as a starting point for policy-makers and researchers to begin deconstructing the urban-centric lens and give those in rural populations the attention and resources they need and deserve.
