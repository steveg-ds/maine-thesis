\begin{abstract}
This paper explores rural housing insecurity through Swope and Hernandezâ€™s (2019) 4 C's of housing insecurity in rural areas. Rural census tracts are defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Urban Code Continuum (RUCA) codes seven through ten to avoid an overly restrictive definition.  Little attention has been paid to rural areas in the conversation on housing, to facilitate further discussion this exploratory study uses unsupervised machine learning to group census tracts into risk levels across 7 sectors of ACS data based on housing insecurity factors found in the literature. Multinomial logistic regression is used to determine variation between states based on how well state risk levels can be predicted with the national dataset. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation is used to analyze how spatially clustered the risk levels and housing insecurity risk variables.  The results indicate that many rural census tracts have a medium risk of housing insecurity, and the risk levels are hard to predict. The spatial autocorrelation results show that the housing insecurity variables are not as highly spatially clustered as expected.

This study delves into the issue of housing insecurity in rural areas using Swope and Hernandez's framework, which identifies four key aspects of housing insecurity. To ensure a comprehensive view, rural areas are defined based on specific codes by the USDA, allowing for a broader scope in the analysis. Despite the limited attention given to rural housing concerns, this research employs unsupervised machine learning techniques to categorize census tracts into risk levels across various data sectors related to housing insecurity.

By utilizing data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and employing multinomial logistic regression, the study assesses the differences among states in predicting housing insecurity risk levels using a national dataset. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation analysis is utilized to gauge the degree of clustering among risk levels and housing insecurity variables.

The findings highlight that a considerable number of rural census tracts face moderate housing insecurity risks, with challenges in accurately predicting these risk levels across states. Surprisingly, the spatial analysis reveals that housing insecurity variables are not as spatially clustered as previously anticipated. This study sheds light on the complexity of housing insecurity in rural areas, offering insights into the unpredictability of risk levels and the spatial distribution of housing insecurity factors.
