\chapter{Results}	

This analysis focused on a sample of 6,364 rural census tracts with a RUCA code of seven or higher. Four states and Washington D.C. were intentionally excluded from the analysis: Alaska and Hawaii were omitted due to the presence of unique factors, particularly in their rural areas, which may not have been adequately addressed in the existing literature.  New Jersey and Rhode Island were excluded from our spatial analysis due to a lack of adequate data. These states are both very urban and once discrepancies in the data were removed, there were not enough observations to include in the analysis.  Figure \ref{fig:neighbors_bar} shows how the neighbor algorithm changed the state census tract counts.

\section{\textit{Cluster Analysis}}

Here, the results of the cluster analysis is presented for each sector. The primary mechanism for analyzing the clusters is the average cluster medians for all states. The cluster averages were analyzed as well to ensure that the same trends are found in the dataset under a different descriptive statistic. All values are represented as a percentage corresponding to the base unit each sector is scaled to. 

\subsection{\textit{Employment Diversity}}
The risk levels for employment diversity are determined based on which clusters have the highest number of highest cluster values compared to the cluster with the lowest number of lowest cluster values. The higher the cluster averages across variables, the better the economic diversity of a cluster. Table \ref{tab:emp} shows the values for this sector. 
Cluster 1 had the lowest cluster medians in 61 percent of variables, 
Cluster 2 has the highest cluster median in 53 percent of variables, and Cluster 3 has the middle value in 69 %nice 
percent of cases. Based on this analysis Cluster one has the lowest level of economic diversity, cluster two has the lowest level of economic diversity, and cluster three has a medium level of economic diversity. Employment in education, health, and social work has the highest presence across each cluster followed by manufacturing.

\subsection{\textit{Demographics}}

Due to the historical forces affecting minorities in both rural and urban areas, the risk levels for demographics are based on which clusters have the highest minority populations and the lowest white populations. 
Table \ref{tab:dem} shows the values for this sector.  This sector was decided based on the median and average highest, lowest, and medium value counts as clusters two and three had almost the same cluster median counts. Cluster three is the middle value for 90 percent of cluster median variables. Cluster three has the highest number of highest values across means and medians with 55 percent of variables. Cluster two is the lowest for 50 percent of variables. Cluster three alsos has the largest African American and Hispanic and Latino cluster medians. Based on this analysis, cluster one has a medium risk of housing insecurity, cluster two has a low risk of housing insecurity and cluster three has the highest risk of housing insecurity. One notable obeservation is that the cluster medians for the male/ female over 18 years old variables are roughly three times higher than the male/ female under 18 variables. This reflects the ageing population of rural areas noted in the literature.

\subsection{\textit{Housing Cost}}

For housing cost, risk levels are determined by which clusters have the highest cluster medians. Cluster 1 has the highest value for mortgage high cost. Cluster 2 has the lowewest mortgage and rent high cost cluster medians. cluster 3 has the highest no mortgage and rent high cost cluster medians. Table \ref{tab:cost} shows the values for this sector. Cluster one becomes the medium risk level, cluster two becomes the low risk level, and cluster three becomes the high risk level. 

\input{tables/clusters/cost_clus_table.tex}

\subsection{\textit{Housing Quality}}

For housing quality, risk levels are determined by which clusters have the highest values, with preference given to occupied housing as housing conditions in unoccupied housing is of a lesser concern than occupied housing. Table \ref{tab:qual} shows the values for this sector. Cluster one has the highest values for unoccupied housing with incomplete kitchens and plumbing. Cluster three has the medium value for each variable.Cluster three has the highest values for occupied housing with incomplete kitchens and plumbing. Cluster one becomes the lowest risk level, cluster two becomes the medium risk level, and cluster three becomes the highest risk level. 

\input{tables/clusters/qual_clus_table.tex}



\subsection{\textit{Residential Mobility: Education}}
For residential mobility: education, the risk levels are determined primarily by the variables for those who moved with less than a high school education and those in the same house with less than a high school education, and the clusters where more people moved overall will be the highest risk levels. Table \ref{tab:trans_edu} shows the values for this sector. Cluster one has the medium value for 71 percent of variables including each less than high school education variable. Cluster two has the lowest values for each variable. cluster 3 has the highest values for 71 percent of variables, including each of the less than high school education variables. Cluster one becomes the lowest risk level because it has medium levels of residential mobility but the highest level of residential stability with a high school education. Cluster two becomes the medium risk level, and cluster three becomes the highest risk level. 

\input{tables/clusters/trans_edu_clus_table.tex}

\subsection{\textit{Residential Mobility: Poverty}}

The residential mobility: poverty sector follows the criteria of residential mobility: education closely with those the variables for those who moved that are below the poverty level are the highest priority. Table \ref{tab:trans_pov} shows the values for this sector. Cluster one has the lowest values for every variable. Cluster two has the medium value for 57 percent of variables. Cluster three has the highest values for 57 percent of variables including three of the below the poverty level variables. Cluster one becomes the lowest risk level, cluster two becomes the medium risk level, and cluster three becomes the highest risk level. One noteable observation from the cluster medians is that cluster three has the highest value of those living in the same house below and above the poverty measure, indicating high levels of poverty for \cts in this cluster.

\input{tables/clusters/trans_pov_clus_table.tex}

\subsection{\textit{Wage and Household Factors}}

For household wage/ aid, the clusters with the highest number of highest cluster medians determines the risk levels with particular attention given to households with no wage and households with three or more workers. Table \ref{tab:waid} shows the values for this sector. Cluster one has the lowest cluster medians for 89 percent of variables. Cluster two has the medium value for 55 percent of variables. Cluster three has the highest values for 55 percent of variables and the middle value for the other variables. Notablable high values for cluster three include the Gini index, households with no vehicle, households with at least one worker and no vehicle, and households receiving supplemental security income.  

\input{tables/clusters/waid_clus_table.tex}

\subsection{\textit{Housing Type}}
For the housing type sector, owner single unit is considered the safest housing while renter and owners of unconventional housing and mobile homes are considered high risk. This sector requires a combination of means and medians for the analysis because for several variables, all cluster medians are zero. Table \ref{tab:hh_type} shows the values for this sector. Cluster three has the highest owner mobile and the medium value for renter mobile. Cluster three has the highest renter and owner unconventional cluster averages. Cluster one has the highest owner single and the lowest renter mobile home. Cluster one becomes the low risk level, cluster two becomes the medium risk level, and cluster three becomes the high risk level.

\input{tables/clusters/hh_type_clus_table.tex}


\section{\textit{Association Rules}}
For 1:1 rules, the rule with the highest confidence and support is between housing type and cost, occurring in 11 percent of transactions with a coverage of 0.29. Wage/ household aid has the most one-one- associations in this group occurring in an average of 1 percent of observations, there is a 36 percent average probability that any of these sectors are in the consequent if wage/ household aid is in the antecedent. In about 9 percent of observations, residential mobility poverty is the consequent if mobility education is the antecedent with a 36 percent probability of a high risk for mobility poverty when there is a high risk of mobility education. mobility education also has an association with employment with 33 percent confidence and 8 percent support. 

Of the 3:1 rules with the top 10 highest confidence values, employment diversity has a relationship with every other sector. Support is low at 5 percent with an average confidence of 0.42 and a slightly positive average lift of 1.1. The two other highest rules are housing type to mobility poverty with support of around twelve percent and a confidence interval of 0.41 and employment to residential mobility poverty with support of six percent and a confidence interval of 0.4. Looking at the top ten 3:1 rules with the highest confidence values, the results are significantly different from the 3:1 rules Employment is in the consequent if any other sector is in the antecedent with an average support of 12 percent, and an average confidence interval of 0.32. This relationship between employment diversity having both high-risk-to-low-risk and high-risk-to-low-risk is a surprising relationship. 

\section{\textit{Moran's I}}

\input{tables/moran/moran_sector_avg.tex}


While the association rules dealt exclusively with the housing insecurity risk levels, Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation is used to examine how values group together in space for all variables. Moran’s I is calculated for every state and the entire dataset.  \hl{rewrite all of this analysis}

%\input{tables/all_moran_table.tex}

\subsection{Moran's I Outliers}
While Moran's I values overall are fairly low, there are some outliers that deserve attention. Demographics, household wage/ aid, do not have any outliers based on the IRQ method.  mobility poverty has 13 outliers. The mean of all mobility poverty observations is 0.19 while the mean for the outliers is 0.47. 69 \pct of these outliers are the same house below the poverty line variable. Connecticut, Nevada, and Arizona have surprisingly high Moran’s I statistics for the mobility poverty risk levels variable. The average for these three states is 0.45 compared to 0.21 for the same variable. There are 4 outliers in the mobility education  with same house less than high school in Ohio, California, and all states. The final outlier is same house with a high school diploma in Maryland. These outliers have an average of 0.61 while all sector observations have an average of 0.23. For housing type, there are two outliers: owner single unit and owner mobile home, both in the South Dakota. These outliers have an average Moran’s I of 0.63 while the sector has an average of 0.25. for Housing quality there are two outliers: occupied incomplete plumbing and occupied incomplete kitchen, both in the state of New Mexico. The sector average is 0.28 while these outliers have an average of 0.66. Housing cost has six outliers: mortgage high cost in Arizona, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, and New Mexico. The variable average is 0.28 while these observations have an average of 0.5. For economic diversity there are 16 outliers. 10 of these observations are for manufacturing in all states, Virginia, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Virginia. The average Moran’s I statistic for this sector was 0.47 while these outliers have an average of 0.68. 5 of these outliers are for the agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining variable in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington, and all states. The average Moran’s I statistic for this variable is 0.36 while these outliers have an average of 0. 61. These outliers provide useful insights into states where conditions do not align with the trends found in the whole dataset and may merit further investigation, especially since all outliers are positive.

\section{\textit{Multinomial Logistic Regression}}

The final method applied in this study is a multinomial logistic regression performed on each sector of data and tested on the data for each state. The probability that a predicted risk level is the actual risk level is used to measure how well the data for each state can be predicted based on a model trained on the other states. Average accuracy for all sectors was low: employment diversity, housing quality, residential mobility: poverty and household factors had an average of 0.34; housing type and housing cost had an average of 0.35; residential mobility: poverty had an average of 0.36; demographics had the highest average accuracy at 0.38. Demographics had the highest standard deviation at 14 percent, indicating a high degree of variation in predictability. Looking at average probability for each sector in each state, Utah had the best prediction results with an average of 41 percent and Minnesota was the hardest to predict at 31 percent between sectors. The standard deviation of every state is 14 percent, indicating a high level of variation in each state. While the standard deviation is significant, the mean and median statistics indicate the data is close to symmetrically distributed.  In the following subsections, the performance of the state models is evaluated based on the confusion matrices of the actual classification and the predicted classifications. Of primary concern is the misclassification of census tracts as misclassifying risk levels could mislead researchers and policy makers. 

\subsection{\textit{Employment Diversity}}
The state models were able to correctly predict 35 percent of census tracts. This model shows a heavy bias towards the \lrl classification. Table \ref{tab:emp_confusion} shows that the model struggled to classify the \mrl, yielding an F1 score of 0.15 compared to 0.44 for the \lrl s and 0.34 for the \hrl s.

When accounting for class imbalance, accuracy increases by 12 to 17 percent.
