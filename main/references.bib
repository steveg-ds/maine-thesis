	abstract = {This paper documents changing patterns of concentrated poverty in nonmetro areas. Data from the Decennial U.S. Census Summary Files show that poverty rates—both overall and for children—declined more rapidly in nonmetro than metro counties in the 1990s. The 1990s also brought large reductions in the number of high-poverty nonmetro counties and declines in the share of rural people, including rural poor people, who were living in them. This suggests that America’s rural pockets of poverty may be ‘‘drying up’’ and that spatial inequality in nonmetro America declined over the 1990s, at least at the county level. On a less optimistic note, concentrated poverty among rural minorities remains exceptionally high. Roughly one-half of all rural blacks and one-third of rural Hispanics live in poor counties. Poor minorities are even more highly concentrated in poor areas. Rural children—especially rural minority children—have poverty rates well above national and nonmetro rates, the concentration of rural minority children is often extreme (i.e., over 80\% lived in high-poverty counties), and the number of nonmetro counties with high levels of persistent child poverty remains high (over 600 counties). Rural poor children may be more disadvantaged than ever, especially if measured by their lack of access to opportunities and divergence with children living elsewhere. Patterns of poverty among rural children—who often grow up to be poor adults—suggest that recent declines in concentrated rural poverty may be short-lived.},

We find that most moves are accompanied by household instability and that households with young children are significantly more likely to experience household instability. These findings imply that researchers attempting to isolate the effects of residential instability, especially for children, should account for the possible influence of household change.},

Given the long history of understanding the relationship between neighbourhood context and residential mobility, this study includes measures of satisfaction, safety, decay and neighbourly agency to understand mobility. Using data from the Making Connections Initiative, this paper uses a unique panel survey across neighbourhoods in 10 US cities undergoing spatial and/or demographic transitions to analyse the extent to which neighbourhood perceptions are associated with residential mobility. By employing a multilevel structural equation model, the study accounts for neighbourhood perceptions, neighbourhood demographics and mobility risk over time. The results show that perceptions of neighbourhood context matter more than the actual neighbourhood setting. These findings highlight the continued importance of subjective rather than objective measures of neighbourhood conditions in understanding residential mobility.},

By applying hybrid models to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, this study estimates the eﬀects of potential household-level predictors on the likelihood of experiencing housing instability. The results show that changes in family employment structure, job insecurity, automobile ownership, and the number of adult family members within a household correlate with housing instability after controlling for changes in household income and housing costs. Moreover, I ﬁnd that households with children are particularly vulnerable to housing instability. These results contribute to identifying valid household-level predictors of housing instability and developing preventive policy interventions that help unsubsidized low-income households achieve housing stability.},

Doubling up can have nega­ tive consequences that should be addressed, but the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s methods for enumerating homelessness exclude these arrangements, and Department of Education counts of dou­ bling up include only school children. We provide a new method for measur­ ing doubled-up homelessness in the total population using American Community Survey public use microdata. Using this method, we find that 3.7 million people in the U.S. population were doubled up in 2019 and show significant differences in doubling up by geography, race and ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, school enrollment, and employment status, and compare these findings with research on sheltered and unshel­ tered homelessness. Notably, rates of Hispanic/Latinx doubled-up homeless­ ness were high, in contrast to their rates of literal homelessness, and some rural areas with low rates of sheltered and unsheltered homelessness had high rates of doubling up. To aid in future research and policy, supplemental materials provide open-source tools for replicating the measure. Findings suggest that policies addressing homelessness and housing insecurity con­ sider those experiencing doubled-up homelessness and that the current measure can assist in those efforts.},

In this paper, we specifically focus on the income effects of migration decisions among young individuals from rural areas, using microdata for Sweden. We find that, contrary to accepted theory, staying in a rural region most often is insignificant in relation to an individual’s income level. When taking housing values into account, it can even be financially beneficial for some to stay in a rural area. Only for highly educated individuals is it consistently financially beneficial to move to an urban area, also after controlling for housing costs.},

            Most research on segregation focuses on racial residential segregation in metropolitan statistical areas and typically uses a-spatial measures of segregation. What is less clear is if segregation measures operate in a similar fashion in nonmetropolitan areas and if spatial patterns exist for poverty segregation in nonmetro counties. The purpose of this research was to examine multiple dimensions of poverty segregation in the United States the period 2006–2010 for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties. Data for this analysis come from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey 5 year estimates, the 2000 U.S. Census of Population and Housing, Summary File 3 and the USDA Economic Research Service. Four different measures of poverty segregation were calculated, including both aspatial and spatial measures. A nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for variation in the segregation indices across metro and nonmetro areas and spatially autoregressive models were used to examine the socioeconomic correlates of poverty segregation. Results indicate significant variation in poverty segregation patterns in metro and nonmetro counties in the US, and nonmetro counties outside of the South have significantly lower levels of poverty segregation. This research adds to the literature by exploring patterns of metro and nonmetro poverty segregation and measuring different dimensions of segregation with an explicit spatial referent across counties in the contiguous United States in an effort to note differences in how segregation works across rural and urban places.},

The historical coincidence of spatial and social boundaries in America is changing rapidly. This review highlights (a) the enormous scale of rural-urban interdependence and boundary crossing, shifting, and blurring—along many dimensions of community life—over the past several decades, and (b) the symmetrical rather than asymmetrical inﬂuences between urban and rural areas, i.e., on bidirectional relational aspects of spatial categories. These general points are illustrated by identifying 10 common conceptions of rural America that reﬂect both its social and economic diversity and its changing spatial and social boundaries. Here we emphasize symbolic and social boundaries—the distinctions between urban and rural communities and people and the processes by which boundaries are engaged. Placing behaviors or organizational forms along a rural-urban continuum (or within a metropolitan hierarchy of places) or drawing sharp rural-urban distinctions seems increasingly obsolete or even problematic. We conclude with a call for new research on rural America and greater conceptual and empirical integration of urban and rural scholarship, which remains disconnected and segregated institutionally.},

We further examine the impact of differential migration rates on African American and Latino poverty rates, two groups that have experienced higher than average poverty rates and have a sizable presence in rural areas. Our analysis indicates that during the 1990s the poor moved at rates equal to or greater than the nonpoor, and that, especially in micropolitan counties, this movement tended to deepen existing poverty concentrations. Both African American and Latino migration patterns tended to reinforce existing poverty concentrations, a result similar to that of the population as a whole, although the migration patterns of both groups more severely exacerbated poverty in high-poverty noncore counties.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss the apparent failure to couple together the constructs of `rurality' and `homelessness', and propose a critical deconstruction of this noncoupling. Three principal lines of arguments are employed. First, there are a range of physical and material reasons why rural and urban spaces have varying qualities for hiding or revealing homeless people, and why the embodied experiences of homelessness have varying geographies. Second, there are a series of obstacles that exist within the practices, thoughts, and discourses of rural dwellers themselves, which lead them to deny that homelessness exists in their place. Third, normalised conceptualisations about rurality and homelessness often serve to separate the two concepts, and contribute to the assumption that homelessness is an urban phenomenon, which is rendered invisible in rural space. In short, homelessness may be conceptualised as being `out-of-place' in the purified spaces of rurality, and the imaginary geographies of rurality and homelessness become transformed into everyday practices and actions relating to what people actually do in and about rural places. This critical deconstruction will be important for any attempts to recouple homelessness and rurality in the understandings and actions of policymakers.},

Policies that address the structural causes of homelessness, described by numerous articles in this ANNALS volume, are the furthest upstream and may be the most important in eradicating homelessness, and policies aimed at prevention are next. We point out that effective prevention requires targeting those most at risk, and we call for creative use of data and better coordination with institutions and systems that may be able to identify the antecedents to homelessness. We note that currently, the homelessness shelter system is strained, so we argue for a radical rethinking of its role, with a shift of resources to efforts further upstream. The existing racial disparities in both pathways to and incidence of homelessness bring urgency to making more than marginal policy changes.},

The relationship between health and housing has long been recognized and, in the last decades, researchers developed several conceptual models to put in relation the numerous housing factors able to impact on inhabitants’ health. For some authors, factors linked to housing and neighborhood conditions that influence health, can be grouped into four broad categories: first considers the health impacts of not having a stable home (residential instability); second, the financial burdens resulting from high-cost housing (affordability); third, the health impacts of conditions inside the home (the housing’ safety and quality); lastly, the health impacts of neighborhoods, including both the environmental and social characteristics of where people live (neighborhood). It is evident that the theme of “housing and health” nowadays needs to be assessed with a multidisciplinary approach, because of the complexity and wideness of its components. Moreover it is today clear that to guarantee good health standards it is indispensable to direct political and administrative choices to improve the overall conditions of the neighborhood and of the buildings, and, At the same time, to dispose of a clear and updated regulatory system, since key factor to ensure Public Health protection and social justice.},

Third, we identiﬁed data sources and searched for archival, population-level data that matched our indicators. Fourth, we systematically tested correlations of indicators within and across the theoretical elements and used this information to select a parsimonious group of indicators. Fifth, we combined the indicators into composites of Economic Development and Social Capital and an additive index of Community Resilience using Mississippi county data, and validated these against a wellestablished index of social vulnerability and aggregated survey data on collective efﬁcacy. We found that our measure of community resilience capacities correlated favorably and as expected when validated with the archival and survey data.

Our objective is to highlight both the conceptual limitations of the so-called rural–urban divide, while also recognising the spatial interdependence of America's ‘rural’ and ‘urban’ people and places. Our analyses nest rural and urban population and places within metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, while acknowledging that rural places often grow into urban places (i.e., urbanisation) and that many nonmetropolitan counties are reclassified over time as metropolitan areas (i.e., metropolitanisation). Analyses show that most rural people—as officially defined—now live in metropolitan counties, often at the fringe. Reclassification to metropolitan areas was a major reason why. Small towns and thinly settled areas at the metropolitan fringe have grown rapidly since 1980 and have become increasingly integrated within metropolitan areas nationally. The heuristic value of our analytical approach at the national level is further demonstrated at the local-area level, in Chicago and Atlanta, metro areas with very different demographic and economic histories. Our study highlights the dynamic and multidimensional nature of spatial boundaries (i.e., urban–rural and metro–nonmetro) that both separate and connect rural and urban areas in the United States. Metro–nonmetro and rural–urban boundaries are neither fixed nor impermeable.},

The second source of model uncertainty is choosing a set of control variables to model the diversityperformance relationship. To overcome these limitations, a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method is used to address model uncertainty when studying the eﬀects of economic diversity on short-term employment growth and long-term economic stability among 359 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) in the contiguous U.S. The potential spatial spillovers are also considered through spatial regression models. This empirical analysis suggests that ignoring model uncertainty can impact the estimates and our understanding of economic diversity, and it also conﬁrms that economic diversity of neighbors plays an important role in regional economic development.},

	abstract = {Background: Although lack of affordable housing is common in the U.S., few studies have examined the association between housing affordability and health.
Purpose: Using quasi-experimental methods, the aim of this study was to examine whether housing affordability is linked to a number of important health outcomes, controlling for perceptions of neighborhood quality, and determining whether this association differs by housing tenure (renting versus owning).
Methods: Data from the 2008 Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey, a telephonebased survey of 10,004 residents of Philadelphia and its four surrounding counties, were analyzed. The association between housing affordability and health outcomes was assessed using propensity score methods to compare individuals who reported living in unaffordable housing situations to similar individuals living in affordable ones.
Results: Overall, 48.4\% reported diffıculty paying housing costs. People living in unaffordable housing had increased odds of poor self-rated health (AORϭ1.75, 95\% CIϭ1.33, 2.29); hypertension (AORϭ1.34, 95\% CIϭ1.07, 1.69); arthritis (AORϭ1.92, 95\% CIϭ1.56, 2.35); cost-related healthcare nonadherence (AORϭ2.94, 95\% CIϭ2.04, 4.25); and cost-related prescription nonadherence (AORϭ2.68, 95\% CIϭ1.95, 3.70). There were no signifıcant associations between housing affordability and heart disease, diabetes, asthma, psychiatric conditions, being uninsured, emergency department visits in the past year, obesity, and being a current smoker. Renting rather than owning a home heightened the association between unaffordable housing and self-rated health (AORϭ2.55, 95\% CIϭ1.93, 3.37 for renters and not signifıcant among homeowners) and cost-related healthcare nonadherence (AORϭ4.74, 95\% CIϭ3.05, 7.35 for renters and AORϭ1.99, 95\% CIϭ1.15, 3.46 for homeowners).
Conclusions: The fınancial strain of unaffordable housing is associated with trade-offs that may harm health. Programs that target housing affordability for both renters and homeowners may be an important means for improving health.},

The ability to maintain homeownership, repeated transitions in partnerships, job insecurity, and repetitively moving across distressed neighborhoods are the conditions for housing instability that occurs more frequently. Moreover, younger households and households with a member with health problems are likely to suffer from more chronic forms of housing instability.},

            In our study, we took a first step toward broadening our understanding of the sources of both housing and wealth inequality by studying differences in housing equity among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and non-Hispanic whites in the United States. Using data from the American Housing Survey, we found substantial and significant gaps in housing equity for blacks and Hispanics (but not for Asians) compared with whites, even after we controlled for a wide range of locational, life-cycle, socioeconomic, family, immigrant, and mortgage characteristics. Furthermore, the payoffs to many factors are notably weaker for minority than for white households. This finding is especially consistent across groups for the effects of age, socioeconomic status, and housing-market value. Blacks and Hispanics also uniformly receive less benefit from mortgage and housing characteristics than do whites. These findings lend credence to the burgeoning stratification perspective on wealth and housing inequality that acknowledges the importance of broader social and institutional processes of racial-ethnic stratification that advantage some groups, whites in this case, over others.},

	abstract = {Although homeownership rates currently stand at historically high levels for all segments of the U.S. population, large gaps in homeownership rates remain when comparing various groups of the population. As of the third quarter of 2006, the non-Hispanic White (hereafter, White) homeownership rate was 76 percent while African-American and Hispanic homeownership rates were below 50 percent and the Asian homeownership rate was 60 percent. The homeownership gap between African-American and White households was larger in 2006 than it was in 1990, while the homeownership gap between Hispanics and Whites was only slightly smaller in 2006 than it was in 1990. Households with very low incomes had a homeownership rate that was 37 percentage points below the rate for high-income households. These gaps have changed little over the past 50 years. The primary goal of this study is to synthesize what is known about the determinants of gaps in homeownership rates by income status and racial and ethnic status. We first present a conceptual framework for analyzing the determinants of homeownership. We then review the literature that identifies the relative importance of various contributing factors to observed homeownership gaps, separating the factors into those that are observed and those that are part of an unexplained residual that represents unmeasured factors such as discrimination, lack of information about the homebuying and mortgage financing processes, and omitted socioeconomic variables.},

	abstract = {One in four Americans lives in a poor neighborhood – deﬁned by a poverty rate of 20\% or higher. The eﬀects of neighborhood poverty on children's health and development depend on the timing and duration of the exposure. Focusing on children born in poor families, we examined the timing and persistence of their exposure to neighborhood poverty from birth to age 17. We also examined family characteristics associated with exposure to neighborhood poverty. Study data are from a national cohort of 634 children born in poor families in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Neighborhood poverty was deﬁned by census tract using residential addresses reported in annual/biennial interviews. Approximately half of the children lived in a poor neighborhood at any age. More than a third lived in a poor neighborhood both at birth and in their last follow-up in adolescence, spending most of their childhood and adolescence in such neighborhoods. Many family demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were signiﬁcantly associated with entering and exiting poor neighborhoods, but only non-white head of household, being born in a poor neighborhood, and parents' tenure in poor neighborhoods before the child's birth were signiﬁcantly positively associated with cumulative exposure to poor neighborhoods (in years). Among children born in poor families, exposure to neighborhood poverty is persistent throughout childhood and adolescence. Children from non-white families and families with a history living in poor neighborhoods are disproportionately exposed to poor neighborhoods. Policies are needed to address structural conditions such as neighborhood racial and income segregation to reduce prolonged exposure to neighborhood poverty among children born into poverty.},

For the poorest residents of these neighborhoods in particular, the expected positive effect of informal social support is suppressed by the negative effect of perceived trauma. These findings present a micro-level account of poverty, social interaction, and political capacity, one that holds implications for scholarship and public policy on participatory inequality.},

The low turnout may be due to the loss of social ties that accompanied mobility.

	abstract = {Over 20 years of scholarship suggests that living in America's poorest and most dangerous communities diminishes the life course development of children and adults. In the 1990s, the dire conditions of some of these neighborhoods, especially those with large public housing developments, prompted significant policy responses. In addition to the demolition and redevelopment of some of the projects, the federal government launched an experiment to help families leave poor neighborhoods through an assisted housing voucher program called Moving to Opportunity (MTO). While families who moved through this program initially relocated to census tracts with poverty rates almost four times lower than their original projects, many returned to communities of moderate to high poverty. Why? We use mixed methods to explore the patterns and the decision–making processes behind moves among MTO families. Focusing on the Baltimore MTO site, we find that traditional theories for residential choice did not fully explain these outcomes. While limited access to public transportation, housing quality problems, and landlords made it hard for families to move to, or stay in, low–poverty neighborhoods, there were also more striking explanations for their residential trajectories. Many families valued the low–poverty neighborhoods they were originally able to access with their vouchers, but when faced with the need to move again, they often sacrificed neighborhood quality for dwelling quality in order to accommodate changing family needs. Having lived in high–poverty neighborhoods most of their lives, they developed a number of coping strategies and beliefs that made them confident they could handle such a consequential trade–off and protect themselves and their children from the dangers of poorer areas.},

Scholars have long documented the social and economic merits of homeownership and explored the factors that influence access to it. However, despite the abundance of literature on homeownership and housing tenure choice, we lack a study that focuses on whether and how debt and wealth influence a household’s decision to own or rent a home. Using 2004 and 2008 panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), this study attempts to identify the causal effect of household debt and wealth on a household’s decision to change tenure choice by examining what factors influence transition from homeowner to renter or from renter to homeowner. Data analysis shows that household secured debt, household wealth, and household income play a significant role in household’s change in tenure choice. While race is not a significant factor influencing the likelihood of a homeowner transitioning to a renter, it was a significant factor for a renter transitioning to a homeowner. Minority renters are significantly less likely to become homeowners compared with white renters, even when controlling for wealth and debt.},

We matched participants in SEH programs to households with similar characteristics from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) over the 1997–2017 period. The findings indicate that in real terms, median SEH homeowners accumulated about \$1,700 in housing wealth annually or around \$10,000 during their holding period. This amount is lower than the \$2,100 median annual gain in home equity experienced by similar PSID owners but statistically and economically significantly larger than the \$16 in annual gain experienced by similar PSID renters. The findings provide evidence that households participating in SEH programs experienced positive, but modest, wealth gains that were slightly lower than those of homeowners in unrestricted units but substantially higher than those of renters.},

After adjusting for covariates, crowding was associated with household food insecurity compared with the securely housed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.30; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.43), as were multiple moves (AOR = 1.91; 95\% CI = 1.59, 2.28). Crowding was also associated with child food insecurity (AOR = 1.47; 95\% CI = 1.34, 1.63), and so were multiple moves (AOR = 2.56; 95\% CI = 2.13, 3.08). Multiple moves were associated with fair or poor child health (AOR = 1.48; 95\% CI = 1.25, 1.76), developmental risk (AOR 1.71; 95\% CI = 1.33, 2.21), and lower weight-for-age z scores (–0.082 vs –0.013; P = .02).
Conclusions. Housing insecurity is associated with poor health, lower weight, and developmental risk among young children. Policies that decrease housing insecurity can promote the health of young children and should be a priority. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1508–1514. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300139)},

	abstract = {Manufactured housing (MH) is a central component of aﬀordable housing in the United States. Yet the MH tenure ranges from manufactured homes on privately owned property to rental units, to owned homes placed on rented lots in mobile home parks. Despite the widespread use of MH, no current research has analyzed the high level of internal variation within MH or documented how this variation impacts housing aﬀordability between MH tenures. Moreover, little is known about the degree of segregation of manufactured homes, which are often clustered in mobile home parks and informal subdivisions. This study represents a ﬁrst-time national analysis of demographic, spatial, and aﬀordability characteristics with regard to variation between MH tenures, using data from the American Housing Survey. By disaggregating various MH tenures and clustered community arrangements, we detail the demographic and geographic characteristics of MH households by housing tenure, analyze how housing costs diﬀer across MH tenures, and demonstrate that MH is highly segregated from the conventional housing stock in a way that impacts housing aﬀordability. These ﬁndings oﬀer policy prescriptions for MH policy speciﬁcally and may contribute to broader aﬀordable housing policy in the United States.},

We evaluate this supposition against the backdrop of past displacement research. Reason-for-move data from seven waves of the American Housing Survey (2001-2013) are used to construct displacement measures that range from narrow (limited to forced moves prompted by government or private action or disaster loss) to broad (also including eviction and foreclosure). Our analysis shows that, regardless of measure, no consistent upward trend over time is apparent in the small percentage of mobile households experiencing displacement, although as many as 3.6 million individuals may be affected biennially. We also find that longstanding socioeconomic, racial, and other disparities in displacement persist but tend to be of modest magnitude. Such patterns could contribute to a perception of displacement as socially unpredictable, further heightening public concern about the issue.},

While the effect of family changes on housing choices has been studied in detail, little is known about childbearing patterns within various housing types, and this despite the fact that many studies suggest housing to be an important determinant of fertility. We use longitudinal register data from Finland and apply hazard regression. First, we observe a significant variation in fertility levels across housing types – fertility is highest among couples living in single-family houses and lowest among those residing in apartments, with the variation remaining significant even after controlling for the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of women. Second, our results show elevated fertility levels after couples have changed dwellings, suggesting that much of the fertility variation across housing types is attributed to selective moves. Third, the study reveals a relatively high risk of third birth for couples in single-family houses several years after the move. This suggests that living in spacious housing and in a family-friendly environment for a relatively long time leads to higher fertility.},

	abstract = {To move towards an understanding of displacement from within, and the forms of its overcoming, the following chapter brings into dialogue the ancient experience of wandering and the 21st century condition of permanent temporariness. It explores whether these are the same or different phenomena, and whether the latter is a uniquely modern experience. In particular, it is interested in the turning points that lead to the defiance of the condition and its regime. It traces modes of existence that subvert the liminal state and allow for possibilities of living beyond the present moment through returns and futures that are part of everyday practices, even if they are splintered. Such actions, it is argued, allow for the repositioning of the self in relation to the world, and thus the exposition of cracks within the status quo. The investigation confronts experiences that appear to be uniquely those of the present day—such as non-arrival and forced immobility. In its exploration it engages current responses to de-placement by those who have experience of the condition first hand. It is a dialogue between the work of such creators as the architects Petti and Hilal, the poets Qasmiyeh and Husseini, and the community builders of Dandara, with ancient discourses of the outcast that are found in Euripides’ Medea, the experience of Xenophon and such philosophers as Diogenes the Cynic. In so doing, it seeks to expose the way seemingly exceptional forms of politics and existence, instead, reveal themselves as society’s ‘systemic edge’.},

However, it has received relatively limited attention in psychological theorizing and research. This article demonstrates the importance of residential mobility in understanding the self, social relationships, and well-being. Recent research has shown that residential mobility (number of moves for an individual or percentage having moved recently for a neighborhood) is associated with the primacy of the personal over the collective self. It is also associated with ‘‘duty-free’’ friendships and group memberships rather than obligatory friendships and group memberships. Overall, residential mobility is associated with lower levels of wellbeing at the individual level of analysis. Finally, residential mobility is associated with personal forms of subjective well-being (based on self-esteem, the verification of the personal self) as opposed to interpersonal forms of subjective well-being (based on social support, the verification of the collective selves). In short, residential mobility is a powerful, parsimonious explanatory construct in the self, social relationships, and subjective well-being and may be a key to understanding the future of mind and behavior in the increasingly mobile world.},

Using data from the 1980 to 2000 decennial census and the 2010-2014 American Community Survey, we examine the association between concentrated poverty across metropolitan areas in the United States and key proximate factors, including overall changes in poverty, racial residential segregation, and income segregation. One of our unique contributions is assessing the relative contribution of each of these to long-term trends in such poverty using a decomposition analysis. We find that changes in the segregation of the poor explained the largest share of the change in concentrated poverty over most of the time period, with the exception of the 1990s, where the plunge in both black and white poverty rates had the largest role in explaining the considerable decline in concentrated poverty in that decade for both groups. The association between racial segregation and black concentrated poverty is positive but weaker, indicating that without declines in black segregation, concentrated poverty would have been higher. Overall, growing income segregation, along with weak economic performance in recent years, have put more poor people at risk for living in high-poverty communities.},

The practical implications of this increase is that data are sometimes so imprecise that they are difﬁcult to use. This paper explains why the ACS tract and block group estimates have large margins of error. Statistical concepts are explained in plain English. ACS margins of error are attributed to speciﬁc methodological decisions made by the Census Bureau. These decisions are best seen as compromises that attempt to balance ﬁnancial constraints against concerns about data quality, timeliness, and geographic precision. In addition, demographic and geographic patterns in ACS data quality are identiﬁed. These patterns are associated with demographic composition of census tracts. Understanding the fundamental causes of uncertainty in the survey suggests a number of geographic strategies for improving the usability and quality ACS.},

Using Virginia data from 2000 to 2006, the study shows that the commuting flow between two locations has a positive and significant effect on the migration flow in the same direction in subsequent years. The underlying reasons are that increased commuting costs or reduced migration costs can induce commuters to become migrants. These results may have useful implications for urban communities in their revitalization efforts, as cities can explore ways of attracting daily commuters to their cities to become permanent residents, reversing the trends of declining urban population.},

As commuting patterns have expanded over time, these areas have become larger and more complex, and the dichotomous designation of a county either belonging to an LMA or not may no longer be adequate. We apply recent advances in network science to conduct a more reﬁned analysis of U.S. commuting patterns, and examine their effects on local economic growth. Results show that network degree and entropy measures explain variations in county per capita income growth patterns. Higher in- and out-commuting entropies are associated with lower per capita income growth, but their interaction enhances economic growth in places simultaneously open to both in- and out-commuters. Using these results, common ground may be found for creating new forms of regional governance that better reﬂect local realities of cross-county border ﬂows of workers and economic activity.},

	abstract = {Commuting ties between rural places of residence and urban places of employment are among the most visible forms of rural-urban integration. For some rural areas, access to urban employment is a key source of population retention and growth. However, this access varies considerably across rural areas, with distance representing a primary deterrent. In addition to distance, the size of the urban community will also influence rural-to-urban commuting opportunities. In this paper, using Canadian data, we empirically estimate the influence of local rural population and job growth on rural outcommuting within the urban hierarchy. We find consistent support for the deconcentration hypothesis where population moves to rural areas for lifestyle and quality of life reasons, while retaining urban employment. Further we find some evidence that in addition to distance from the nearest urban center being a deterrent, increased remoteness from the top of the urban hierarchy exerts a positive influence on out-commuting. Recognition of these types of rural-urban linkages through commuting is essential in designing Canadian rural policy and targeted programs that may effectively support local rural populations. In particular, they point to the need to have reasonable transportation infrastructure for urban accessibility, which should be complemented by other “built” infrastructure to improve the livability of rural communities.},

Our framework integrates structural forces—such as income inequality, an affordable housing shortage, social exclusion, and inadequate safety net programs—with the personal circumstances and challenges that shape individuals’ homeless trajectories. The macro-micro perspective also helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, and it highlights variation across contexts in how the dynamics of homelessness operate. In a separate section, we introduce the sixteen core articles of this volume against the macro-micro backdrop. Finally, we discuss two emergent macro “shocks” (the COVID-19 pandemic and climate-related hazards) that are largely absent from the volume but carry important implications for understanding and addressing homelessness in the future.},

We assemble novel data linking individuals from housing court cases in New York City to administrative data and leverage the random assignment of cases to courtrooms to estimate the causal eﬀect of evictions on homelessness, health, earnings, employment, and public assistance receipt. Evictions cause large and persistent increases in risk of homelessness, elevate long-term residential instability, and increase emergency room use. We ﬁnd some evidence that evictions lower earnings modestly, but little evidence that they substantially worsen employment outcomes or increase receipt of public assistance.

In this article, we examine the effects of job accessibility in places of various degrees of poverty concentrations, focusing on the employment status and commute distance of the poor. Using the Los Angeles metropolitan area as the case study, we find that spatial access does not explain unequal employment status of the poor: the association between access and employment status is insignificant in almost all places regardless of the poverty rates. Poor job seekers cannot take advantage of proximity to jobs even if they live in low-poverty places. The only exceptions are the places that experienced increases in both poverty rates and job access, where the estimation of job accessibility’s effects tends to be upwardly biased. The association between job accessibility and commute distance is significant in places with low to medium poverty rates, meaning that for poor workers who live in low-poverty neighborhoods, proximity to jobs can reduce their commute distance. For those who live in high-poverty places, proximity to jobs does not significantly affect their commute distances. These findings challenge the optimistic expectations of housing dispersion programs, at least their effects on employment status.},

	abstract = {In the U.S., households with less than one car per driver (auto-deficit households) are more than twice as common as zero-vehicle households. Yet we know very little about these households and their travel behavior. In this study, therefore, we examine whether car deficits, like carlessness, are largely a result of financial constraint or of other factors such as built environment characteristics, household structure, or household resources. We then analyze the mobility outcomes of car-deficit households compared to the severely restricted mobility of carless households and the largely uninhibited movement of fullyequipped households, households with at least one car per driver. Data from the California Household Travel Survey show that car-deficit households are different than fullyequipped households. They have different household characteristics, travel less, and are more likely to use public transit. While many auto-deficit households have incomes that presumably enable them to successfully manage with fewer cars than adults, low-income auto-deficit households are—by definition—income constrained. Our analysis suggests that low-income car-deficit households manage their travel needs by carefully negotiating the use of household vehicles. In so doing, they travel far more than carless households and use their household vehicles almost as much as low-income households with at least one car per driver. These results suggest that the mobility benefits of having at least one car per driver are more limited than we had anticipated. Results also indicate the importance of transportation and employment programs to ease the potential difficulties associated with sharing cars among household drivers.},

Using principal components analysis and cluster analysis, I report the prevalence of socioeconomic ascent, based on increases in neighborhood income, rents, house values, and educational and occupational attainment, among five to seven types of neighborhoods in each decade. I also examine population and housing changes that co–occur with ascent to identify processes of ascent beyond gentrification. Overall, findings suggest mixed implications for neighborhood inequality. While white suburban neighborhoods make up the bulk of neighborhoods that ascend in each decade, minority and immigrant neighborhoods become increasingly likely to ascend over time, though displacement may occur.},

Drawing on earlier empirical and theoretical attempts to understand gentrification and urban change, this paper shows it is possible to analyse existing patterns and processes of neighbourhood change to identify areas likely to experience change in the future. This is evidenced through an analysis of socio-economic transition in London neighbourhoods (based on 2001 and 2011 Census variables) which is used to predict those areas most likely to demonstrate ‘uplift’ or ‘decline’ by 2021. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of such modelling for the understanding of gentrification processes, noting that if qualitative work on gentrification and neighbourhood change is to offer more than a rigorous post-mortem then intensive, qualitative case studies must be confronted with – and complemented by – predictions stemming from other, more extensive approaches. As a demonstration of the capabilities of machine learning, this paper underlines the continuing value of quantitative approaches in understanding complex urban processes such as gentrification.},

To confront displacement concerns, cities are adapting models developed within academia to identify neighbourhoods that may be susceptible to gentrification and displacement. We compare four gentrification and displacement risk models developed by and for the US cities of Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles, California; Portland, Oregon; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and apply all four methodologies to one city, Boston. We identify the geographic areas of agreement and disagreement among the methods. The comparison reveals striking differences between the models, both in inputs and outputs. Of the 18 variables considered among the four models, only two variables appear in all four models. In the resulting maps, the four methods identified between 25 and 119 of the 180 Boston census tracts as at risk of gentrification and displacement, or as currently gentrifying. There are only seven tracts that all four models agreed were either gentrifying or at risk of gentrification and displacement. The findings indicate a need for cities to consider critically the assumptions of the models that are included in urban policy documents, as indicators and thresholds have major impacts on how neighbourhoods in the liminal space of gentrification and displacement are characterised. This novel comparison of United States local government analyses of gentrification provides insight as modelling moves from theory to practice.},

	abstract = {Few sociologists treat housing as a key independent variable, despite the emergence of disparate bodies of research analyzing how housing affects outcomes that traditionally interest sociologists. Scholars across the social sciences have proposed and tested mechanisms whereby housing could shape subjective well-being, socioeconomic status, demography, and politics. We review the evidence for causal effects across these domains. Next, we make recommendations for research designs to advance this literature. Most studies only test effects of homeownership, and most are focused on the United States and Western Europe. The evidence for causation is often weak, although studies increasingly employ complex techniques for identifying effects. Throughout, we emphasize studies beyond the United States, and we conclude by discussing distinctive insights yielded by comparative research. We advocate for a comparative perspective and more expansive conceptualization of housing status as a means to build theory and evidence regarding the conditions under which housing exerts effects.},

	abstract = {Rural-urban classifications are essential for analyzing geographic, demographic, environmental, and social processes across the rural-urban continuum. Most existing classifications are, however, only available at relatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United States. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial resolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly localized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into encroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications are often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data (e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the longitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. Here, we develop a set of distance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the remoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods of time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by constructing indices of urbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018 and further test the plausibility of our results against a variety of evaluation datasets. We call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL) and make the resulting datasets publicly available (https://doi.org/10.3886/E162941) so that other researchers can conduct long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and rural change. In addition, due to the simplistic nature of the input data, these methods can be generalized to other time periods or regions of the world, particularly to data-scarce environments.},

Internal migrants are defined as individuals who moved subnationally to their current address in the previous 12 months, as indicated by the replies to the 2001 and 2011 census question about usual address 1 year ago. Our analysis reveals declining rural in-migration rates between 2001 and 2011, in parallel with other recent studies of internal migration. At the same time, uneven geographies of rural in-migration are identified. In rural places with declining in-migration rates, we emphasise the immobilities of settled gentrifiers that are caused by predilections to ‘stay put’ within prized, rural places for age-related personal/emotional, social/support and economic reasons. This is limiting the supply pipeline of housing for latent in-migrants and slowing flows of migration per se in saturated rural housing markets. By contrast, rural places with increasing inmigration rates may signify new frontiers of gentrification, providing channels of entry for recent migrants that are not able to buy into exclusive high-cost gentrified markets. Our novel argument is that despite gentrification being inherently a process of migration, when viewed in a broader temporal perspective, mature and exclusive forms of gentrification can also stifle migration and be the catalyst for immobilities.},

	abstract = {The effects of the Great Recession on housing equity and homeownership have been well-documented. However, we know little about how rental households fared and the efficacy of housing subsidies in addressing affordability gaps. This paper examines the extent to which rental housing became less affordable for Extremely Low-Income (ELI) households – those earning less than 30\% of the Area Median Income (AMI). I then run regression models to determine the local characteristics most strongly associated with larger affordability gaps, with a focus on whether housing subsidies are effective at combating such gaps. Rental affordability gaps became more pronounced during the Great Recession. In nearly 70\% of the counties in my sample, there was an increase from 2007 to 2010 in the number of ELI households per affordable rental unit. Across the country, the increase was 17\%, a dramatic increase in only three years. There is considerable variation across the country, with acute affordability crises often concentrated in the South, particularly Florida. Regression models provide compelling evidence that housing vouchers, public housing, and project-based Section 8 subsidies play an important role in limiting the extent to which large numbers of ELI households are competing for a shortage of low-cost rental units. However, these programmes do not respond quickly to local needs – such as those brought about by the Great Recession. A pilot study where local housing authorities had funding to be more agile and responsive would be an important step toward crafting better policy.},

	abstract = {Can immigration save rural and small town America? Our goal is to highlight the new racial dynamics of population change in nonmetropolitan areas, where slowing population growth rates since 1990 eventuated in widespread depopulation during the post-2010 period. We use 3141 counties as the unit of analysis, tracking population change data over the 1990 to 2017 period. Our results, based on decennial census counts and population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, show that Hispanic population growth has been spatially ubiquitous, occurring in both declining and growing nonmetropolitan counties. Hispanic growth has slowed but not reversed chronic declines in rural population. Significantly, the growth of Latinos benefited a majority of historically depopulating or declining nonmetropolitan counties as well as nonmetropolitan counties that have continued to grow. Our analyses also reveal substantial heterogeneity in patterns of population change in nonmetropolitan America. Latino population growth often makes the difference between overall county population growth and decline. Nearly 200 nonmetropolitan counties grew during the 2010–2017 period, but only because Hispanic population increases offset non-Hispanic population declines. For these counties, which account for about 10 percent of all nonmetropolitan counties, Latinos clearly provided a demographic lifeline. Hispanics population gains were usually insufficient to reverse population declines in historically depopulating counties but nevertheless slowed the pace of decline. Hispanic growth was greatest in counties where the population was growing, resulting in a demographic multiplier effect.},

This integrative literature synthesis considers the known and potential impacts of families’ housing affordability problems on child development and schooling outcomes through a review of 64 studies published between 2000 and 2020. The synthesis proceeds in three sections: the first section examines research on the direct connection between affordability and child outcomes. The second section considers the empirical evidence on four pathways through which affordability problems are theorized to affect child outcomes: the residential mobility pathway (by causing residential mobility, school mobility, eviction, or homelessness), the living environment pathway (by reducing the quality of housing or living conditions), the neighborhood and school opportunity pathway (by restricting access to high-opportunity neighborhoods and schools), and the parental resources pathway (by reducing financial resources that could be invested in children and increasing parental stress). The third section of the synthesis considers affordability’s impact on children through an examination of the research literature on the impact of federal housing assistance. Future directions for policy are considered, including the expansion of housing assistance for families, and additional research is urged on the impacts of housing affordability on children by scholars within the field of education.},

For small entrepreneurs self-funding R\&D, higher spending on housing could reduce the resources available for innovative investments. For larger firms, higher housing costs may make it more difficult to attract the human resources necessary to fuel innovation (scientists, engineers, technicians, programmers, etc.). Conversely, however, housing cost growth tracks with growth in home values, and higher home values can support innovation and risk-taking for entrepreneurs who borrow against home equity. I examine the net effects of these pressures using a sample of Florida counties from 2005 to 2019. Within counties over my time period, housing cost growth predicts fewer patent filings. Specifically, my tests suggest that shifting county-wide rents for a one-bedroom apartment upwards by \$100 (15\%) predicts 8\% fewer patent applications emanating from the county. I confirm this result in an instrumental variables test that exploits county-level tourist tax policy changes that induce otherwise exogenous variation in housing costs. Overall, my findings support a causal relation wherein higher housing costs discourage innovation.},

Second, we use exploratory spatial methods to identify geographic patterns in county-level poverty dynamics between 2000 and 2012. Third, we estimate the share of the population living in high-poverty counties, and track changes over time and by race and poverty status. Overall, we ﬁnd a substantial increase in concentrated poverty since 2000. Increases in both the number of high-poverty counties and the share of the population living in these counties were widespread, though spatially and temporally uneven in some cases. We also observe convergence in concentrated poverty between rural and micropolitan areas, and between non-Hispanic white and Hispanic populations. Overall, we observe a reversal of the declines in concentrated poverty that occurred in the 1990s, and ﬁnd that in many cases this trend began prior to the Great Recession.},

	abstract = {Housing conditions have been an enduring focus for public health activity throughout the modern public health era. However, the nature of the housing and health challenge has changed in response to an evolution in the understanding of the diverse factors inﬂuencing public health. Today, the traditional public health emphasis on the type and quality of housing merges with other wider determinants of health. These include the neighbourhood, community, and “place” where a house is located, but also the policies which make access to a healthy house possible and affordable for everyone. Encouragingly, these approaches to policy and action on housing have the potential to contribute to the “triple win” of health and well-being, equity, and environmental sustainability. However, more effective housing policies (and in public health in general) that adopt more systemic approaches to addressing the complex interactions between health, housing, and wider environment are needed. This paper illustrates some of the key components of the housing and health challenge in developed countries, and presents a conceptual model to co-ordinate activities that can deliver the “triple win.” This is achieved by offering a perspective on how to navigate more effectively, inclusively and across sectors when identifying sustainable housing interventions.},

The poverty rate, or percent of the population considered poor under the official definition, was reported at 15.0\% in 2012, a level statistically unchanged from the two previous years. The 2012 poverty rate of 15.0\% is well above its most recent pre-recession low of 12.3\% (2006) and remains at a level not last seen since 1993. Poverty in the United States increased markedly from 2007 through 2010, in tandem with the economic recession (officially marked as running from December 2007 to June 2009). Little if any improvement in the level of “official” U.S. poverty has been seen since the recession’s official end, with the poverty rate remaining at about 15\% for the past three years. Some analysts expect U.S. poverty to remain above pre-recession levels through much, if not most, of the remainder of the decade, given the slow pace of economic recovery. The pre-recession poverty rate of 12.3\% in 2006 was well above the 2000 rate of 11.3\%, which marked an historical low (a rate statistically tied with the previous historical low of 11.1\% in 1973).},

	abstract = {Early arguments over the "culture of poverty" assumed considerable inter­ generational transmission of poverty but differed over whether this was due to cultural inadequacies of the poor or to structural barriers and discrimination faced by the poor. These arguments subsided by the 1970s when quantitative social stratification studies such as Blau \& Duncan (1967) found that inter­ generational socioeconomic mobility was considerable and that there was little evidence for a "vicious cycle of poverty." In the 1 980s the issue of inter­ generational poverty reemerged when research o n new longitudinal datasets suggested that both intragenerational and intergenerational poverty were more persistent than analyses based on cross-sectional data had suggested. Four new theoretical perspectives were developed to explain intergenerational poverty: the resources model, the correlated disadvantages model, the welfare culture model, and Wilson's (1987) underclass model. This review summarizes and evaluates recent empirical research on the extent to which being raised in poor families, in non-intact families, in welfare-dependent families, and/or in un­ derclass neighborhoods facilitates or hinders children' s adult attainments. The review assesses how well each of the four new models are supported by this research.},

              Low‐income families receiving public benefits in the United States are often subject to asset limits for eligibility, which some argue to be counterproductive to their long‐term economic stability. Previous research suggests that families were more likely to save when asset limits increased after welfare reform in 1996. The current study builds upon this work for the years before and after the Great Recession.
            
            
              Methods
              This study utilized data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Assets and bank account ownership of low‐income female‐headed households were compared to multiple control groups for the years 2003–2013 using a difference‐in‐difference analytical approach.
            
            
              Results
              Results suggest that wealth is associated with race and income, but not with asset limit policies. Bank account ownership was similarly unaffected by Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) policy.
            
            
              Conclusions
              It is likely that TANF policies are only one of the many barriers to asset accumulation faced by low‐income families, especially in a period of recession.},

Methods. We used National Health Interview Survey data (1999–2012) linked to US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administrative records (1999–2014) to examine differences in reported fair or poor health and psychological distress. We used multivariable models to compare those currently receiving HUD housing assistance (public housing, housing choice vouchers, and multifamily housing) with those who will receive housing assistance within 2 years (the average duration of HUD waitlists) to account for selection into HUD assistance.
Results. We found reduced odds of fair or poor health for current public housing (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 0.57, 0.97) and multifamily housing (OR = 0.75; 95\% CI = 0.60, 0.95) residents compared with future residents. Public housing residents also had reduced odds of psychological distress (OR = 0.59; 95\% CI = 0.40, 0.86). These differences were not mediated by neighborhood-level characteristics, and we did not ﬁnd any health beneﬁts for current housing choice voucher recipients.

In the U.S. states largely determine the benefits for many of the public assistance and social insurance programs, leading to large variation in the benefits across the country.

              Journal
              , we have examined whether American welfare recipients possess beliefs and attitudes that differ from mainstream public opinion. Although our findings cast doubt on the existence of a widespread ‘culture of dependence’, we do show that programme beneficiaries exhibit self-interested support for government policies that provide assistance to needy segments of the population. However, our analysis – like most others on this topic – assumes that welfare participation affects opinions and not vice versa. This is problematic because there are theoretical reasons to believe that influences flow in the opposite direction, as well. Therefore, some important questions remain to be answered: is it really the case that welfare participation, itself, shapes the outlook of programme beneficiaries? Or do political attitudes affect reliance on public assistance in the first place?
            
            In this Research Note, we examine the underlying structure of the relationship between welfare participation and attitudes towards government activity. Our analysis uses the 1992 Center for Political Studies (CPS) National Election Study, the same dataset employed in the earlier article. But, we test a statistical model that allows for reciprocal influences between welfare and public opinion. The empirical results reinforce the earlier conclusion that welfare participation has an impact on mass attitudes. Conversely, political attitudes have no effect on whether citizens use public aid. Mirroring our earlier work, we find that people who rely on governmental assistance take rational, self-interested positions on the public policy issues which operate to their own direct benefit.},

	abstract = {Attaining economic parity and reducing poverty between the genders are critical steps toward attaining the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Despite progress, women in the US still earn USD 0.83 for every USD 1.00 that a man earns. With rising shares of single/femaleheaded households with children in American society in recent years, such gaps in earnings exacerbate the misery of children living in such households. In 2019, female-headed households with children had poverty rates almost twice (36.5\%) that of single/male-headed families (16.3\%). This paper uses ﬁve-year American Community Survey estimates from the National Historical Geographic Information System to empirically examine the spatial distribution and determinants of femaleversus-male-headed households with children living in poverty in the counties of the USA. Lower levels of educational attainment are associated with higher levels of poverty for both genders. A bachelor’s degree in education is associated with higher poverty for female-headed households, whereas majoring in business, sciences, engineering, and arts/humanities is associated with lower poverty for male-headed households. Service-sector occupations inherently contribute to higher poverty for both groups. Over-representation in management/professional and natural-resources, construction, and maintenance-type occupations works well for male-headed households, whereas management/professional, sales/ofﬁce, and service-based occupations associate with higher poverty for female-headed households—pointing toward the “working poor”—comprising largely of the active female labor force in the new economy. Full- and part-time work status alleviates poverty for female-headed households, whereas part-time work is associated with higher poverty for males.},

We estimate deep (less than 20\% of medians) and extreme (less than 10\% of medians) poverty in the United States from 1993 to 2016. Using the Current Population Survey, we match the income definition of the Luxembourg Income Study and adjust for underreporting using the Urban Institute’s TRIM3 model. In 2016, we estimate that 5.2 to 7.2 million Americans (1.6\% to 2.2\%) were deeply poor and 2.6 to 3.7 million (0.8\% to 1.2\%) were extremely poor. Although deep and extreme poverty fluctuated over time, including declines from 1993 to 1995 and 2007 to 2010, we find significant increases from lows in 1995 to peaks in 2016 in both deep (increases of 48\% to 93\%) and extreme poverty (increases of 54\% to 111\%). We even find significant increases with thresholds anchored at 1993 medians. With homelessness added, deep poverty would be 7\% to 8\% higher and extreme poverty 19\% to 23\% higher in 2016, which suggests that our estimates are probably lower bounds. The rise of deep/extreme poverty is concentrated among childless households. Among households with children, the expansion of SNAP benefits has led to declines in deep/extreme poverty. Ultimately, we demonstrate that estimates of deep/extreme poverty depend critically on the quality of income measurement.},

	abstract = {Background
              Research clearly demonstrates that income matters greatly to health. However, income distribution and its relationship to poverty risk is often misunderstood.
            
            
              Methods
              We provide a structural account of income distribution and poverty risk in the U.S., rooted in the ‘roles’ that individuals inhabit with relation to the ‘factor payment system’ (market distribution of income to individuals through wages and asset ownership). Principal roles are child, older adult, and, among working-age adults, disabled individual, student, unemployed individual, caregiver, or paid laborer. Moreover, the roles of other members of an individual’s household also influence an individual’s income level. This account implies that 1) roles other than paid laborer will be associated with greater poverty risk, 2) household composition will be associated with poverty risk, and 3) income support policies for those not able to engage in paid labor are critical for avoiding poverty. We test hypotheses implied by this account using 2019 and 2022 U.S. Census Current Population Survey data. The exposure variables in our analyses relate to roles and household composition. The outcomes relate to income and poverty risk.
            
            
              Results
              In 2019, 40.1 million individuals (12.7\% of the population) experienced poverty under the U.S. Census’ Supplemental Poverty Measure. All roles other than paid laborer were associated with greater poverty risk (p {\textless} .001 for all comparisons). Household composition, particularly more children and disabled working-age adults, and fewer paid laborers, was also associated with greater poverty risk (p {\textless} .001 for all comparisons). Five key policy areas—child benefits, older-age pensions, disability and sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and out-of-pocket healthcare spending—represented gaps in the welfare state strongly associated with poverty risk.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The role one inhabits and household composition are associated with poverty risk. This understanding of income distribution and poverty risk may be useful for social policy.},

Rent levels constitute an issue effectively overlooked in the poverty determinants literature. The present study estimates a panel data set inclusive of control variables for the US state of Virginia, which provided all the data needed for the analysis. Panel least squares (PLS) estimations using county ﬁxed effects and period ﬁxed effects for the period 2008–17 ﬁnd poverty inversely related to median income and the percentage of the population with at least a high-school diploma. Poverty also is found to be positively related to the percentage of the population employed in mining; the percentage of the population classiﬁed as obese; and the unemployment rate. Finally, poverty in Virginia is, as hypothesized here, an increasing function of rent. Higher monthly rental levels on one-bedroom apartments increase the percentage of the population in poverty; indeed, a US\$100 per month increase in rent would elevate the overall poverty rate in the state by 1.20–1.35\%.},

The independent variable was housing insecurity derived from the question on worry about paying rent or mortgage. The outcome measures were health services utilization (no usual source of care, no routine checkup in the past 1 year, and delayed medical care due to cost), self-rated health (number of days reported physical, mental health not good, and poor overall health), and number of chronic diseases (0, 1, 2 or more). The covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, level of education, marital status, and number of children in the family. We also adjusted for state ﬁxed effects and survey year. We performed ␹2 tests and binary logistic regressions on categorical variables and ran t tests and estimated linear regression models on continuous variables. Multinomial logistic regressions were estimated for the number of chronic diseases.
Results: Of the 228,131 adults in the study sample, 28,704 adults reported housing insecurity. We found that those with housing insecurity were more likely to forgo routine check-ups and lack usual sources of care. Low-income individuals, minorities, the unmarried, and middle-aged adults were more likely to report housing insecurity.
Conclusion: Housing insecurity is associated with worse access to preventive and primary care. Interventions to enhance access for these patients should be developed and studied. (J Am Board Fam Med 2019;32:521–530.)},

	abstract = {Housing instability (inability to pay rent, frequent moves, doubling up, eviction, or homelessness) is common among low-income households and is linked with a host of negative outcomes for families and children. As rents have risen and wages have not kept pace, housing affordability has declined over the last 15 years, increasing rates of housing instability. In this study, we examine whether the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a key US social welfare policy and one of the largest cash transfer programs in the US, reduces housing instability. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study and the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we employ a simulated instruments strategy to examine whether policy-induced expansions in the EITC reduce housing instability. Results suggest that a \$1,000 increase in the EITC reduces doubling up (living with other non-nuclear family adults) 3 to 5 percentage points. We find some suggestive evidence that the EITC decreases the average number of moves per year (0.05 moves). While our results suggest that the EITC does decrease certain, less severe forms of housing instability, we find no evidence that the EITC decreases more extreme (and rarer) forms of housing instability: eviction or homelessness.},

Previous research has found many negative consequences of food insecurity for families and households but has not examined its relationship with housing instability. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, difference-in-difference models show that food insecurity is associated with housing instability. The association remains statistically significant after accounting for potential selection and unobserved heterogeneity using propensity score matching and excluding households that experienced prior housing instability from the sample. Examining potential mediating factors, I find that material hardship explains about half of this association. These findings suggest that maintaining a strong social safety net would reduce the risk that families experience material hardship and housing instability, which may also reduce the risk of homelessness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homelessness and hunger are associated with poor health outcomes. Housing instability and food insecurity describe less severe problems securing housing and food.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between housing instability and food insecurity and access to ambulatory health care and rates of acute health care utilization. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of the National Survey of American Families. PARTICIPANTS: 16,651 low-income adults. MEASUREMENT: Self-reported measures of past-year access: (1) not having a usual source of care, (2) postponing needed medical care, or (3) postponing medication; and past-year utilization: (1) not having an ambulatory care visit, (2) having emergency department (ED) visits, or (3) inpatient hospitalization.
RESULTS: 23.6\% of subjects had housing instability and 42.7\% had food insecurity. In multivariate logistic regression models, housing instability was independently associated with not having a usual source of care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.31, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 1.59), postponing needed medical care (AOR 1.84, 95\% CI 1.46 to 2.31) and postponing medications (AOR 2.16, 95\% CI 1.70 to 2.74), increased ED use (AOR: 1.43, 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.70), and hospitalizations (AOR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.67). Food insecurity was independently associated with postponing needed medical care (AOR 1.74, 95\% CI 1.38 to 2.21) and postponing medications (AOR 2.15, 95\% CI 1.62 to 2.85), increased ED use (AOR 1.39, 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.66), and hospitalizations (AOR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.85).
CONCLUSIONS: Housing instability and food insecurity are associated with poor access to ambulatory care and high rates of acute care. These competing life demands may lead to delays in seeking care and predispose to acute care.},

In the past decade, there has been a surge of scholarship in an emerging sociology of housing that focuses on housing insecurity, forced moves, landlords, shared housing arrangements, and the stratification effects of housing policy. While other fields typically define housing insecurity as affordability, this new literature shows how housing insecurity is not only rooted in financial constraints but also situated within social relationships that create or dissolve housing arrangements, and is exacerbated or remediated by supply-side institutions and policy. This work makes clear that housing insecurity is not a one-time discrete event but a dynamic process, and that sociologists can contribute not only to measuring housing insecurity but also to understanding the social forces that shape it.},

Employing a propensity score matching technique, we find evidence that individuals who remain in subsidized units are significantly less likely to experience rent burden, become homeless, or live in overcrowded environments. They also face lower odds of poverty than their eligible non-/past-assisted counterparts. However, we find that living in subsidized housing has almost no impact on material hardship.

An analysis was then made of whether these determinants varied by income group. The results indicated that low-income adults rapidly convert rising income into additional mobility at faster rates than higher-income adults. Further, automobile ownership increases person miles traveled for all adults; however, it is particularly influential in increasing the travel of low-income adults. Households accrue greater marginal benefits by moving from zero to one vehicle than by purchasing additional vehicles when they already own one or more. These findings underscore the importance of automobile ownership to the mobility of low-income households and suggest an important role for policy in facilitating low-income auto ownership.},

	abstract = {Since its recognition as a social problem in the 1980s, homelessness has not abated. A signature feature of contemporary homelessness is a life in public. Sociological research on the relationship between “sheltered” and “street” homeless populations emphasize their overlapping nature. Yet many homeless people who create “makeshift” housing solutions actively resist shelterization and contest the view that they are in fact homeless. Examining the resources and risks associated with makeshift housing suggests that it provides increased social and structural opportunities yet comes with risks that threaten community longevity. Vehicles are a type of makeshift housing that offer the potential for privacy, ownership, and mobility, unique resources among makeshifts. Using the case of otherwise homeless people living in their vehicles in Santa Barbara, California, this article examines how they acquire and maintain their vehicles and explores the conditions that provide for or threaten their status as a semipermanent housing solution.},

By incorporating measures of perceived fulillment of basic needs, the understanding of afordability can be broadened to include the challenging circumstances of rural areas.},

Deﬁnitional inconsistencies and data limitations rendered early work during this period largely speculative in nature. Thanks to conceptual, theoretical, and methodological progress, however, the research literature now provides a fuller understanding of homelessness. Contributions by sociologists and other social scientists since the mid-1990s differentiate among types of homelessness, provide credible demographic estimates, and show how being homeless affects a person’s life chances and coping strategies. Agreement also exists about the main macro- and micro-level causes of homelessness. Active lines of inquiry examine public, media, and governmental responses to the problem as well as homeless people’s efforts to mobilize on their own behalf. Despite the obstacles faced when studying a stigmatized population marked by high turnover and weak anchors to place, recent investigations have signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced homelessness policy. A greater emphasis on prevention should further strengthen the research-policy nexus.},

	abstract = {This paper considers an unexamined mechanism in the selection processes that sort the urban poor into different neighborhood environments: the landlord. Scholars of poverty and residential mobility have long been interested in how the choices of low–income families interact with structural barriers to create high–poverty neighborhoods that reproduce social and economic isolation as well as racial segregation. However, they have not examined the ways in which these choices are shaped by the intermediary force of the landlord. This paper draws on ethnographic observation and in–depth interviews with 20 landlords and 82 residents in Baltimore, examining their engagement with the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. Findings show that landlords’ strategic implementations of voucher rules contribute to residential sorting patterns through a three–step process: first, selection, in which targeted recruitment tactics favor voucher tenants; second, a sorting process in which landlords cherry–pick the lower–end voucher tenants, matching them to hard–to–rent units; and third, landlords’ selective retention of tenants who do not have the means to leave. This results in rigging the game, where a process of “reverse selection” operates: Rather than tenants selecting homes and neighborhoods, landlords are selecting tenants. Taken together, these tactics result in a strategic balkanization of the rental housing market that retains voucher holders where they can be most profitable—in the very neighborhoods policymakers would like to provide them with the opportunity to leave. Landlord tactics serve as a powerful mechanism in the concentration of poverty.

Por largo tiempo los investigadores de la pobreza y de la movilidad residencial han estado interesados en cómo las elecciones de familias de bajos ingresos interactúan con barreras estructurales para generar barrios de alta pobreza que reproducen el aislamiento social y económico así como la segregación racial. Sin embargo, no han examinado las formas en que estas elecciones son formadas por la acción intermediaria de los propietarios. Este artículo se basa en información etnográfica y en entrevistas en profundidad con veinte propietarios y ochenta y dos residentes en Baltimore, y se examina su compromiso con el programa Housing Choice Voucher (HCV). Los resultados muestran que las implementaciones estratégicas de la HCV de parte de los propietarios contribuyen a los patrones de selección residencial a través de un proceso de tres pasos: primero, selección, en la cual tácticas de reclutamiento focalizadas favorecen a los inquilinos con vouchers; segundo, un proceso de ordenamiento en el cual los propietarios seleccionan y escogen a los inquilinos con vouchers menos deseables, colocándolos en unidades que son difíciles de alquilar; y tercero, retención selectiva de inquilinos sin medios por parte de los propietarios. Juntas, estas tácticas resultan en una balcanización selectiva del mercado de alquiler de viviendas que retiene a poseedores de vouchers en donde estos pueden resultar más convenientes –en los mismos barrios en donde los hacedores de políticas quisieran darles la oportunidad de salir. Las tácticas de los propietarios sirven como un mecanismo poderoso para la concentración de la pobreza.},

	abstract = {While the Great Recession and the associated rise in foreclosures signiﬁcantly impacted households across the United States, default rates in rural areas and rural-urban foreclosure differences have failed to attract substantial research attention. To expand the scale and scope of the foreclosure literature, this article examines place-based differences in estimated foreclosure rates across U.S. counties, which are classiﬁed as urban, suburban, micropolitan, or rural. Defaults are considered both overall and for each county classiﬁcation, and are related to income distribution and inequality, homeownership, adjudication of default, place-based factors including amenity scores and proximity to urban areas, and geographic region. The article ﬁnds a complex relationship among these variables, with inequality itself negatively associated with default rates and lowermiddle2income households positively related to foreclosure. Further, while proximity to urban areas is positively related to foreclosure rates among nonurban counties, natural amenities are related to lower default rates in these areas. The article concludes by considering policy implications, and recommends expanding foreclosure mitigation and prevention strategies to nonurban places.},

Rising exposure increases unemployment, lowers labor force participation, and reduces wages in local labor markets. Conservatively, it explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in exposed labor markets.},

However, while research on mobile home residence at the individual level has been performed, a geographic understanding of mobile home prevalence in the United States remains absent from the literature. Therefore, the purpose of our analysis was to evaluate the county-level drivers of mobile home prevalence in the continental United States in 2015. The influence of five groups of variables – demographic, economic, housing, industry and occupation, and natural amenities – were assessed in a series of nested OLS regressions. Additionally, the full model was run as a spatial lag regression to control for spatial autocorrelation. Our results indicate that the primary drivers of mobile home prevalence in U.S. counties were the percent of population near poverty, the labor force participation rate, and the percent of the population employed in natural resource occupations.},

However, the recent housing crisis, shifting demographics, and deepening inequality may have increased neighborhood problems outside of cities. This article describes trends in neighborhood quality across the rural-urban continuum and considers how these trends differ by race/ethnicity. We use data from the 1985 to 2013 American Housing Survey to examine neighborhood problems surrounding a sample of 125,049 housing units in central cities, suburbs, exurbs, and rural areas. We find that rates of neighborhood problems are consistently highest in cities, but they have been steadily increasing in nonmetropolitan areas. We also find that disparities in exposure to neighborhood problems among racial and ethnic groups are not limited to cities: blacks and Latinos living outside of metropolitan areas are increasingly and disproportionately exposed to neighborhood problems. Further research should examine both the causes and consequences of neighborhood problems across the rural-urban continuum.},

In some communities, however, factors such as slow wage growth, lack of transit options, and lack of access to credit play a larger role in explaining why families cannot afford housing with access to good jobs. To effectively address housing challenges and apply the right mix of policy and regulatory solutions, local leaders must first understand the unique aspects of their housing markets. This research examines the interactions between housing market characteristics—including demographic, economic, and housing supply factors—across 754 U.S. cities with populations greater than 50,000 to help guide solutions. The analysis finds that cities tend to cluster together based on how well the number of approved building permits meets the needs of residents.},

	abstract = {The 30-percent of income standard is a widely used and accepted measure of the extent of housing affordability problems across the country. While simple and easy to implement, the measure is not perfect. The limitations of the 30-percent standard have long been recognized: its rigid uniformity amidst a diverse and ever-changing array of affordability challenges raises questions about its validity over time and across markets and household types. This paper examines whether an alternative measure, based on the concept of residual income, produces a different assessment of the extent and incidence of housing affordability challenges. In the end, this paper finds that, compared to the residual income measure, the 30-percent standard tends to overstate housing affordability challenges for highcost markets and for higher-income and smaller households but yields similar results regarding overall levels of affordability. Thus, given the simplicity of the 30-percent standard, it remains a reliable indicator of affordability both over time and across markets. Caution, however, should be used in using this measure assess affordability challenges among different income levels or household types as variations in the cost of other necessities would suggest the need for corresponding variations in the payment standard used.},

The author addresses this need by analyzing data from the Quality of Working Life module of the General Social Survey, which was asked of respondents in 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. The author finds that while characteristics of secure work are still associated with lower perceived job insecurity, most tend to increase perceived labor market insecurity. The author also finds that the Great Recession produced higher levels of perceived labor market insecurity. These findings suggest that jobs previously considered to be “good” jobs such as government and union jobs may be more of a liability than an asset in the context of decreased employer–worker attachment.},

Methods. We obtained (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER (Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) data (1970–2016) on 104 million deaths; (2) US Census data on education, poverty, and race; and (3) Bureau of Economic Analysis data on income. We calculated ordinary least square regression models, including interaction models, for each year. We graphed standardized parameter estimates for 47 years.
Results. Rural–urban mortality disparities increased from the mid-1980s through 2016. We found education, race, and rurality to be strong predictors; we found strong interactions between percentage poverty and percentage rural, indicating that the largest penalty was in high-poverty, rural counties.
Conclusions. The rural–urban mortality disparity was persistent, growing, and large when compared to other place-based disparities. The penalty had evolved into a highpoverty, rural penalty that rivaled the effects of education and exceeded the effects of race by 2016.},

	abstract = {Household water insecurity is a global threat to human health and development, yet existing metrics lack a systematic consideration of geographic inequality and spatial variation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of plumbing poverty as a conceptual and methodological heuristic to examine the intersectional nature of infrastructure, space, and social inequality. Plumbing poverty is understood in a dual sense: first, as a material and infrastructural condition produced by social relations that fundamentally vary through space, and second, as a methodology that operationalizes the spatial exploration of social inequality. Drawing on millions of census records, we strip household water security down to a single vital measure—the presence of complete household plumbing—to assess its spatial and sociodemographic trends. We identify distinct hot spots (geographic clusters of higher-than-average values) of plumbing poverty, track its social and spatial variance, and expose its fundamentally racialized nature. Our study finds that plumbing poverty is neither spatially nor socially random in the United States. Rather, plumbing incompleteness is spatially clustered in certain regions of the country and is clearly racialized: living in an American Indian or Alaskan Native, black, or Hispanic household increases the odds of being plumbing poor, and these predictors warp and woof through space. In considering who experiences the slow violence of infrastructural dysfunction, a geography that is simultaneously ignored and unevenly expressed in America, we argue that analyses of space and social difference are central to understanding household water insecurity and must be prioritized in the development of cross-comparable metrics and global measurement tools.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the history of internal migration in the United States since the 1980s. By most measures, internal migration in the United States is at a 30-year low. The widespread decline in migration rates across a large number of subpopulations suggests that broad-based economic forces are likely responsible for the decrease. An obvious question is the extent to which the recent housing market contraction and the recession may have caused this downward trend in migration: after all, relocation activity often involves both housing market activity and changes in employment. However, we find relatively small roles for both of these cyclical factors. While we will suggest a few other possible explanations for the recent decrease in migration, the puzzle remains. Finally, we compare U.S. migration to other developed countries. Despite the steady decline in U.S. migration, the commonly held belief that Americans are more mobile than their European counterparts still appears to hold true.},

Research on homelessness in the 1980s has been prompted by the increased numbers and visibility of homeless persons including men, women, and families, as well as young people without families. Most empirical research employs a working definition of homelessness as the condition of those people who are without a permanent place to live. However, a wide range in perspectives differ over what homelessness is. In part, this reflects recognition of some the dynamics of homelessness that include intermittent movement in and out of homeless situations. But it also reflects changes in social values over what constitutes adequate housing. Research shows that the population of homeless persons is diverse, although most homeless persons are young and single. Many have severe chronic problems including mental illness, alcoholism, physical disabilities, and poor health. A significant number have criminal histories. Many were raised in fo...},

Results identify twelve statistically distinct groupings and that over three thousand subcounty places had poverty rates of nearly 20 percent above the national average going back to 1980. However, less than 50 percent of these fall within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Persistent Poverty Counties. The new typology shows the diversity of poverty in terms and identifies places based on poverty's relative severity. The typology also uniquely identifies places that moved into and out of high poverty and identifies many poor places that are ``statistically invisible'' using existing typologies.

	abstract = {Persistent poverty is overwhelmingly rural and is very geographically concentrated. We have redefined the USDA ERS persistent poverty classification to include metropolitan counties meeting the 20 percent or higher poor criterion and we extend the time period through the 2000 Census. With this updated definition, there are 382 counties that have had poverty rates of 20 percent or more in each decennial census between 1960 and 2000. These persistent poverty counties are overwhelmingly rural (95 percent) and disproportionately rural (16 percent of nonmetro counties versus 2 percent of metro). The local economic environment in persistent poverty counties is much less favorable than in the nation as a whole. Per capita income is lower and unemployment rates higher in persistent poverty counties. Employment is more concentrated in services, extractive, construction/maintenance, and production/transportation occupations. Residents of persistent poverty counties tend to have lower education levels, and persistent poverty counties generally have larger shares of minority populations. The number of persistent poverty counties reduced considerably during the 1990s, but the "leavers" were disproportionately metropolitan, making persistent poverty increasingly a rural problem. Persistent poverty is overwhelmingly rural and it is very concentrated geographically. In this paper, we examine these striking regularities in U.S. economic geography, seeking to understand the causes and dynamics of poverty across the rural urban continuum. We also consider how alternative characterizations of "persistent poverty" and "rural and urban" might deepen our understanding of poverty and place. The paper has four sections. In the first, we examine how poverty and persistent poverty vary across the Rural Urban Continuum Codes and Urban Influence Codes developed by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS). We start with the very useful "persistent poverty" classification developed by ERS that defines nonmetropolitan counties as persistent poverty counties if the poverty rate is 20 percent or higher in each decennial census between 1960 and 1990.We redefine persistent poverty to include metropolitan counties meeting the 20 percent or more poor criterion and we extend the time period through the 2000 Census. We also examine where poverty is concentrated in the United States and how persistent poverty varies across the new Core Based Statistical Area definitions for counties, developed recently by the Office of Management and Budget. In the second section, we examine how the demographic characteristics of the population vary across the rural-urban spectrum, comparing persistent poverty county demographics with those of all counties. The third section examines the dynamics of poverty and place. We examine the location, rurality and demographics of counties that escaped persistent poverty statues between 1990 and 2000, and how those characteristics compare to counties that remained in persistent poverty. We then identify the new entrants into high poverty since 1960. In the fourth section, we consider implications of reconceptualizing both "persistent poverty" and "rural and urban diversity". First, we explore the "persistent poverty" county classification, and how alternative definitions of persistent poverty counties might alter the conclusions one reaches about the geography of persistent poverty. We do this by exploring how defining persistent poverty with a different base year such as 1970 or 1980 affects the number of "persistent poverty" counties. We then explore what happens to "persistent poverty" if we raise the poverty threshold to 30 and 40 percent in defining persistent poverty counties. We then examine how conclusions about rural and urban persistent poverty change if one looks at poverty persistence in individual households rather than counties. Using PSID data, this analysis examines rates of persistent household poverty by looking at how the percent of households who remain in poverty for all 5 years during the 1993-98 period varies across central metro county to remote rural county continuum (an aggregation of Beale codes). Finally, we briefly explore how conclusions about the geography of poverty change if one divides metropolitan areas into "central city" and "suburb", and nonmetropolitan areas into "adjacent" and "nonadjacent."},

The TG-12 estimated the number of urban households to be 81.35 million and urban housing shortage to be 18.78 million in 2012. Households living in congested conditions were found to be one of the main factors leading to these housing shortages. Households from economically weaker sections and lower income groups accounted majorly for these shortages. Among caste and ethnic groups, housing shortages were found to be high for Scheduled Caste households than Scheduled Tribe and other households, mainly on account of congestion factor.

              Rural development policy in the US lacks coordination and coherence, but sustaining prosperous rural communities should be a primary aim. We identify rural non‐core counties that remained prosperous during the recent recession and use regression analysis to model the relationship between rural prosperity and
              per capita
              federal expenditures. The number of prosperous rural non‐core counties increased from 2000 to 2010. Social capital and educational attainment are now more important predictors of rural prosperity than economic diversity. Prosperous rural non‐core counties are associated with higher rates of expenditure and the distribution of federal expenditures across these counties exhibits positive spatial dependence.

            Resumen
            
              Aunque la política de desarrollo rural en los EE.UU. carece de coordinación y coherencia, uno de sus objetivos primordiales debería ser el mantener comunidades rurales prósperas. Se identificaron los condados rurales no centrales que permanecieron siendo prósperos durante la recesión más reciente y se empleó un análisis de regresión para modelizar la relación entre la prosperidad rural y el gasto federal
              per cápita
              . El número de condados rurales no centrales prósperos aumentó de 2000 a 2010. En este momento, el capital social y los logros educativos son dos predictores de la prosperidad rural más importantes que la diversidad económica. Los condados rurales no centrales prósperos están asociados con mayores tasas de gasto y la distribución del gasto federal en estos condados muestra una dependencia espacial positiva.

            米国の地方開発政策は整合性と一貫性に欠けているが、経済的に繁栄した地域コミュニティーを維持することを主たる目標とするべきである。本論文では、最近の景気後退の時期にも繁栄が続いた非中核的な郡を識別し、回帰分析を用いて地域の繁栄と一人当たり連邦支出の関係をモデル化する。繁栄する非中核的郡の数は、2000年から2010年にかけて増えている。地方の繁栄に関しては、経済的より、経済的社会資本と教育水準が現在では重要な予測因子である。非中核的郡の繁栄は、より大きい支出の割合と関連しており、これらの郡に関する連邦支出の分布は、正の空間的な依存性を示している。},

	abstract = {Rural America is commonly viewed as a repository of virtuous and patriotic values, deeply rooted in a proud immigrant history of farmers and industrious working-class White ethnics from northern Europe. These views are not always consistent with the population and socioeconomic realities of rural terrains. Exceptions to these stereotypes are self-evident among large poor racial/ethnic minorities residing in rural ghettos in the “dirty” South and among poor Whites living in remote, mountainous areas of Appalachia. For these disadvantaged populations, sociocultural and economic isolation, a lack of quality education, too few jobs, and poor health have taken a human toll, generation after generation. Moreover, the past several decades have brought dramatic shifts in the spatial distribution and magnitude of poverty in these areas. And, America’s persistent racial inequalities have continued to fester as rural communities become home to urban-origin racial minority migrants and immigrants from Mexico and Latin America. As a result, the face of rural America has changed, quite literally. In this article, we address the primary question these changes pose: How will shifting inequalities anchored in poverty and race shape health disparities in a “new” rural America? Guided by fundamental cause theory, we explore the scope and sources of poverty and race inequalities in rural America, how patterns in these inequalities are transduced within families, and what these inequalities mean for the future of health disparities within and across rural U.S. terrains. Our goal is to review and interrogate the extant literature on this topic with the intent of offering recommendations for future research.},

This paper seeks to put together various arguments related to financialization (in the broad sense) from a macroeconomic point of view and evaluate their relevance by confronting them with the actual development of macroeconomic variables for EU countries. The paper discusses changes in investment behaviour, consumption behaviour and government expenditures, investigating to what extent changes are related to financialization. Households experience higher debt levels. Rising profits of businesses come with only moderate investment. The notion of a ?finance-dominated? accumulation regime is proposed to highlight that financial developments crucially shape the pattern and pace of accumulation. The finance-dominated accumulation regime is characterized by mediocre growth performance and a high degree of fragility. However, so far deregulated financial markets have not lead to major financial crises in advanced capitalist economies. A possible reason for this is that the size of the state sector has not been substantially reduced despite neo-liberal attempts to do so.},

This raises the question of whether poverty-reducing policies should be directed more at helping people or helping the places where they reside. Using a variety of approaches, including geographically weighted regression analysis, we find that local job growth especially reduces poverty in persistent-poverty counties. Findings also show that these counties do not respond more sluggishly to exogenous shocks. Finally, this analysis identifies some key geographic differences among persistent-poverty clusters. Taken together, place-based economic development has a potential role for reducing poverty in these counties.},

The analysis controls for individual, dwelling, and temporal fixed effects, and is robust to changes in socioeconomic status, lifestyle choices, and neighborhood conditions. As a robustness check, we use home renovations as major a trigger of changes in housing conditions. Restricting the analysis to tenants, whose renovations are paid by landlords, we document that home renovations significantly reduce doctor visits, corroborating the findings on home conditions and health outcomes.},

              The relative cost of living in rural areas has long been of interest to rural sociologists. Today, the popular perception is that rural prices are lower. This study examines geographic differences in the costs of living in Kentucky. The results indicate that, contrary to the popular perception, when prices of the same products and services were compared, there was no consistent pattern of lower prices in the rural counties. Furthermore, differences in the material conditions of rural living meant that there were additional costs that price comparisons alone did not capture.},

In addition to the overall cost of living, it generates indexes for each of six component subindexes: groceries, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services. These estimates find that the average urban resident of Pennsylvania pays about 6 percent more than rural residents for a broad basket of goods and services. Moreover, urban residents pay more on average for all six major categories of goods, with the greatest difference (12.7 percent) occurring for housing costs. Interestingly, the article also finds that the efficiency of the local public sector can affect local cost of living.

In this article, we explicate the theory, review key findings, discuss refinements and limits to the theory, and discuss implications for health policies that might reduce health inequalities. We advocate policies that encourage medical and other health-promoting advances while at the same time breaking or weakening the link between these advances and socioeconomic resources. This can be accomplished either by reducing disparities in socioeconomic resources themselves or by developing interventions that, by their nature, are more equally distributed across SES groups.},

            To receive federal homeless funds, communities are required to produce statistically reliable, unduplicated counts or estimates of homeless persons in sheltered and unsheltered locations during a one-night period (within the last ten days of January) called a point-in-time (PIT) count. In Los Angeles, a general population telephone survey was implemented to estimate the number of unsheltered homeless adults who are hidden from view during the PIT count. Two estimation approaches were investigated: i) the number of homeless persons identified as living on private property, which employed a conventional household weight for the estimated total (Horvitz-Thompson approach); and ii) the number of homeless persons identified as living on a neighbor’s property, which employed an additional adjustment derived from the size of the neighborhood network to estimate the total (multiplicity-based approach). This article compares the results of these two methods and discusses the implications therein.},

One, designed by the U.S. Census Bureau, separates the territory of the nation into urban and rural. Its intent is to differentiate urban and rural. The other, designed under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), focuses on the integration of urban and rural within metropolitan and micropolitan areas. Forgetting the distinction between separation and integration is dangerous, for example, when (mis)using the OMB system as if it differentiated between urban and rural. At stake is the misunderstanding of rural conditions, the misdirection of federal programs and funds, and a breakdown of communication that confuses people. This article presents two alternatives that can strengthen the foundations of research and policy and uses one of them to analyze rural distress and prosperity. Much can be gained by using these better rural definitions to replicate important research to see whether key findings hold true and to review eligibility requirements and funding procedures to determine whether government programs are reaching the rural people and places they are intended to serve.},

              Industrial clusters are widely understood as a worthwhile target of local economic development resources. Nevertheless, most of the work on cluster development has asserted benefits that accrue to a regional economy as a whole, with little or no focus on specific links between clusters and poverty alleviation. This article seeks to understand the degree to which economic clusters are associated with lower poverty rates. Specifically, using spatial regression analysis techniques, we examine patterns that link clusters to poverty rates while controlling for the presence of other factors that shape the distribution of poverty in the
              U
              nited
              S
              tates. When controlling for other economic and demographic factors in a multivariate framework, the presence of industrial clusters is associated with lower poverty rates. Moreover, regions with a higher share of employment in clusters, and with that employment dispersed across many industries within the same cluster, fare even better than those where employment is concentrated in a single industry. Furthermore, while there is evidence that particular clusters are associated with significantly altered poverty rates, not all of these associations are beneficial.},

A combination of political and economic events since the 1960s has driven increases in poverty that, by 1991, had surpassed 1928 depression era levels in some accounts. This paper explores how the emerging field of behavioral economics can use machine learning and data science methods to explore preventative responses to homelessness. In this study, machine learning data mining strategies, specifically K-means cluster analysis and later, decision trees, were used to understand how environmental factors and resultant behaviors can contribute to the experience of homelessness. Prevention of the first homeless event is especially important as studies show that if a person has experienced homelessness once, they are 2.6 times more likely to have another homeless episode. Study findings demonstrate that when someone is at risk for not being able to pay utility bills at the same time as they experience challenges with two or more of the other social determinants of health, the individual is statistically significantly more likely to have their first homeless event. Additionally, for men over 50 who are not in the workforce, have a health hardship, and experience two or more other social determinants of health hardships at the same time, the individual has a high statistically significant probability of experiencing homelessness for the first time.},

            A wealth of research identifies industrial structure as a central correlate of place‐level poverty and suggests that changes in and the clustering of industry contribute to the spatial clustering of poverty over time. However, few studies have investigated the spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously, and none have effectively examined spatiotemporal interactions. Consequently, a core tenet of theory on poverty in place has not been adequately examined. To address this limitation, we explicitly test hypotheses about systematic variation in the poverty‐industry relationship over time and across space using a new method to quantify dynamic associations by simultaneously accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelation and relationship heterogeneity. The Upper Midwest is our study site given dramatic regional changes in dominant industries (i.e., manufacturing, services, and agriculture) and poverty during the past several decades. We find that the specific character of the poverty‐industry relationship systematically varies along both the temporal and spatial dimensions: Industry is more protective in certain periods than in others according to sector trends, and is more protective in certain places than others conditional on sector dependence. Our approach yields a more precise and reliable understanding of the effect of the long reach of local industrial structure on the spatial clustering of poverty.},

	abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shownby Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associatedquantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the averagequantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemesfor 26 quanta, b = 1,2, t ,7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

If a polyhedral distance is  used,  the problem  can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave  function  on  a  polyhedral  set  which  is  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  a  bilinear  program:  minimizing  a  bilinear  function  on  a  polyhe(cid:173) dral  set.  A  fast  finite  k-Median  Algorithm  consisting  of solving  few  linear  programs in  closed  form  leads  to a  stationary point  of  the bilinear program.  Computational testing on  a number of real(cid:173) world  databases  was  carried  out.  On  the  Wisconsin  Diagnostic  Breast  Cancer  (WDBC)  database,  k-Median  training set  correct(cid:173) ness was comparable to that of the k-Mean Algorithm,  however its  testing set correctness was  better.  Additionally,  on the Wisconsin  Prognostic  Breast  Cancer  (WPBC)  database,  distinct  and  clini(cid:173) cally  important  survival  curves  were  extracted  by  the  k-Median  Algorithm,  whereas  the  k-Mean  Algorithm  failed  to  obtain such  distinct survival curves for  the same database.},

            Data mining has become a well-established discipline within the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) and knowledge engineering (KE). It has its roots in machine learning and statistics, but encompasses other areas of computer science. It has received much interest over the last decade as advances in computer hardware have provided the processing power to enable large-scale data mining to be conducted. Unlike other innovations in AI and KE, data mining can be argued to be an application rather then a technology and thus can be expected to remain topical for the foreseeable future. This paper presents a brief review of the history of data mining, up to the present day, and some insights into future directions.},

In a series of simulation experiments LSM is compared to well‐known spatial weights matrix specifications—two different contiguity configurations, three different inverse distance formulations, and three semi‐variance models. The simulation experiments are carried out on a random spatial pattern and two types of spatial clustering patterns. The LSM performed best according to the Akaike Information Criterion, a spatial autoregressive coefficient evaluation, and Moran's I tests on residuals. The flexibility inherent in the LSM allows for its favorable performance when compared to the rigidity of the global models.},

	abstract = {The k-means clustering algorithm is considered one of the most powerful and popular data mining algorithms in the research community. However, despite its popularity, the algorithm has certain limitations, including problems associated with random initialization of the centroids which leads to unexpected convergence. Additionally, such a clustering algorithm requires the number of clusters to be defined beforehand, which is responsible for different cluster shapes and outlier effects. A fundamental problem of the k-means algorithm is its inability to handle various data types. This paper provides a structured and synoptic overview of research conducted on the k-means algorithm to overcome such shortcomings. Variants of the k-means algorithms including their recent developments are discussed, where their effectiveness is investigated based on the experimental analysis of a variety of datasets. The detailed experimental analysis along with a thorough comparison among different k-means clustering algorithms differentiates our work compared to other existing survey papers. Furthermore, it outlines a clear and thorough understanding of the k-means algorithm along with its different research directions.},

Web mining is the application of data mining techniques to extract knowledge from web data, including web documents, hyperlinks between documents, us-age logs of web sites, etc. Web servers record and accumulate data about user interactions whenever requests for resources are received. Analyzing the web access logs of different web sites can help understand the user behavior and the web structure, thereby improving the website design. Log record has useful information such as URL, IP address, time and so on. Analyzing and discovering log help us to find more potential users of the web site and trace service quality of the site. Clustering is one of the most important research areas in the field of data mining .Clustering is the process of classifying objects into different groups by partitioning sets of data into a series of subsets called clusters. There are two types of clustering algorithms that is k-medoid and k-mean. It is a process of grouping data objects into disjoint clusters so that the data in each cluster are similar, yet different to the other clusters.},

We also show how the best features of the two proposedalgorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database.},

	abstract = {To date a clear, simple, and concise definition of spatial autocorrelation has eluded the literature, although an increasing number of publications concerned with this concept have appeared in recent years. The scope of this problem is explored here, in a search for a meaning of spatial autocorrelation that is understandable to the average numerate geographer. The primary finding is that this concept can take on any one of the following nine different meanings: self-correlation attributable to the geographical ordering of data; a descriptor of the nature and degree of certain types of map pattern; an index of the information content latent in geo-referenced data, especially that information overlooked by classical statistical estimators when applied to spatial data series; a diagnostic tool for spatial model misspecifi- cation; a surrogate for unobserved geographic variables; a nuisance in applying conventional statistical methodology to spatial data series; an indicator of the appropriateness of, and possibly an artifact of, areal unit demarcation; a spatial process mechanism; and a spatial spillover effect. Each definition is spelled out, in turn, and either numerically or conceptually illustrated. One purpose of this exercise is to aid in the dissemination of introductory spatial statistical understanding throughout the geography community. The importance of attaining this goal lies in uses and potential abuses of spatial statistics that may accompany the proliferation of GIS throughout the technical community.

            RÉSUMÉ.— Qu'est-ce que l'autocorrélation spatiale? Réflexions sur 25 ans de statistiques spatiales. — II n'existe pas à ce jour de définition simple, claire et concise de l' autocorrélation spatiale, bien qu'il y ait eu ces dernières années un nombre croissant de publications en rapport avec ce concept. L'auteur cherche à rendre compréhensible l'autocorrélation spatiale au géographe moyen possédant un minimum de connaissances mathématiques. D apparaît en premier lieu que ce concept peut revêtir neuf significations différentes: la corrélation d'une variable avec elle-même provenant de l'ordonnancement géographique des données; un instrument de description de la nature et de l'intensité d'une structure spatiale; un indicateur de la quantité d'information latente contenue dans les données spatialisées, en particulier l'information qui s'avère toujours négligée dans les estimations statistiques classiques quand elles sont appliquées aux séries de données spatiales; un outil permettant de repérer l'existence de variables significatives, mais non prises en compte dans le modèle; un substitut à des données manquantes; un obstacle pour l'application des méthodologies statistiques conventionnelles à des séries de données spatiales; un indicateur du bien-fondé d'une partition spatiale, voire un artefact introduit par les frontières; un mécanisme d'un processus spatial; enfin, un effet de redistribution sur les lieux avoisinants. L'article détaille tour à tour chacune des définitions avant de les illustrer soit par des exemples numériques soit de manière conceptuelle. La compréhension des statistiques spatiales est essentielle, étant donné l'utilisation croissante et les abus potentiels qui risquent fort de se produire avec la prolifération des SIG parmi la communauté des techniciens.},

	abstract = {The logistic curve was introduced by Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed in 1920 and was heavily promoted as a description of human and animal population growth. In subsequent years it underwent a barrage of criticism from statisticians, economists, and biologists, a barrage directed mostly against Pearl's claim that the logistic curve was a law of growth. Nevertheless, it emerged in the mid-1930's as a central model of experimental population biology, and in its various modifications has remained an important part of modern population ecology. The history of the logistic curve reveals that its acceptance was by no means straightforward: repeated promotion of the curve by Pearl and his connections to other scientists were both important in the establishment of its place as a tool of research. The people responsible for legitimizing the logistic curve - A. J. Lotka, G. F. Gause, G. Udny Yule, and Thomas Park - all had different degrees of direct contact with Pearl in the early years of its use, and these personal contacts facilitated the acceptance of the logistic curve despite the heawy criticisms. The history of the logistic curve reveals the complicated social processes which can underlie the development of scientific disciplines.},

This may be due to an over reliance on statistical software or lack of awareness of the value that computation of the proportional by chance accuracy criteria (PCC) and proportional reduction in error (PRE) statistic can add to binary logistic regression models. Case illustrations are used in this paper to demonstrate the usefulness of these computations. An overview of logistic regression is proffered along with a discussion of the function of case classifications and strategies in application of the PCC and PRE. It offers guidance for others interested in understanding how classification tables can be maximized to assess the predictive effectiveness and utility of binary logistic regression models.},

In geography, the importance of the work of Michael F. Dacey, Andrew D. Cliff, and J. Keith Ord is emphasized. Later, with the publication of a volume on spatial econometrics by Luc Anselin, spatial research and the use of the concept of spatial autocorrelation received a considerable boost.

We also show how the best features of the two proposedalgorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database.},

            Gentrification research provides many important insights into the transformation of contemporary urban landscapes, yet more careful attention to nature's role in this process is necessary. This essay begins by highlighting how gentrification research has traditionally overlooked the environmental factors of gentrification and continues by showing how researchers are beginning to account for the urban natural environment in gentrification processes. Such an environmentally sensitive approach to gentrification—one that accounts for nature being used by powerful groups as a tool of social power but also leaves room for it to be a dynamic material actor—can aid scholars' understanding of this important urban process.},

	abstract = {It has long been noted that electing members of the U.S. House of Representatives in single-member, mutually exclusive districts often leads to discrepancies between the partisanship of the electorate and the party distribution in the House. There has been a spirited debate in the literature about the extent to which this is due to demographic clustering or intentional gerrymandering. This study presents direct tests of both of these potential causes using a simulation-based approach that improves upon similar studies in the past. We find that while there is a significant amount of demographic clustering, redistricting procedures account for a much greater portion of the partisan bias in the House. Furthermore, our results indicate that, in the 113th Congress (2013–15), Republicans were overrepresented in the House by about 16 seats, of which only a few can be attributed to demographic clustering.},
