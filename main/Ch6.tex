Future research should use this study as a starting point for giving housing insecurity and homelessness adequate attention. The most important direction is to identify community level risk factors unique to rural areas. Further studies should also use a wider range of data sources to capture sectors with few available variables such as housing conditions. From our spatial analysis there are several observations worthy of further investigation. Subsequent investigations should focus on examining rural housing insecurity at a localized level. This will enable the refinement and enhancement of the existing model, providing more precise insights into the unique challenges faced by rural communities.	Future endeavors should prioritize a closer examination of regions exhibiting unexpected high-risk-to-low-risk and low-risk-to-high-risk relationships, as identified through association rules. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to these unexpected relationships is essential for targeted interventions and policy recommendations. There is a need for in-depth research to discern how levels and trends in income inequality differ between urban and rural areas, shedding light on the specific socio-economic dynamics impacting housing insecurity in each setting. Future research should scrutinize the distinctions in poverty and housing cost dynamics between rural and urban areas, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the factors at play in each context. By addressing these research gaps, researchers can better inform evidence-based policies and interventions that mitigate housing insecurity and advance the well-being of rural populations. As we strive to enhance housing security and social equity in both rural and urban landscapes, interdisciplinary collaboration and persistent research efforts will remain pivotal in driving meaningful societal change. We encourage scholars and practitioners to join hands in this endeavor, working collectively towards a future where safe and stable housing is a fundamental right for all.
